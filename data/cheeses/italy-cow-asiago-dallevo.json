  "description": "Asiago Dallevo is a distinguished hard cheese originating from the Asiago plateau in the Veneto region of Italy. Crafted exclusively from cow's milk, this cheese is celebrated for its dense texture and rich, nutty flavor that deepens with age. The rind of Asiago Dallevo is typically hard and straw-colored, encasing a pale yellow interior that may feature small, scattered eyes. Its aging process, which can range from several months to over a year, contributes to its complex flavor profile and firm consistency, making it a versatile cheese for both table and culinary use.",
  "history": "Asiago cheese has a storied history that dates back to the Middle Ages, originally produced in the Alpine pastures of the Asiago plateau. The Dallevo variant, while less documented, is part of this rich tradition, embodying the artisanal techniques and regional characteristics of its homeland. Asiago cheese was traditionally made from sheep's milk, but over centuries, cow's milk became the standard due to its abundance in the region. Asiago Dallevo, like its counterparts, plays a significant role in Italian culinary culture, often featured in traditional dishes and as a staple on cheese boards.",
  "productionProcess": "Asiago Dallevo is produced using pasteurized cow's milk, which is curdled with the addition of rennet. The curds are then cut, cooked, and pressed into molds to form the cheese. After molding, the cheese undergoes a brining process to enhance flavor and preservation. The aging process is crucial for Asiago Dallevo, with the cheese being aged in controlled environments for a minimum of several months. This aging allows the development of its characteristic flavors and textures, with longer aging periods resulting in a sharper, more pronounced taste.",
  "flavorProfile": "Asiago Dallevo offers a rich and nutty flavor, with a slightly sweet undertone that becomes more intense with age. Its aroma is earthy and inviting, with hints of butter and toasted nuts. The texture is firm and crumbly, yet it melts beautifully when heated, making it a delightful addition to a variety of dishes.",
  "pairings": "Asiago Dallevo pairs wonderfully with full-bodied red wines such as Amarone or Barolo, which complement its robust flavor. For beer enthusiasts, a dark ale or stout can match the cheese's intensity. On the table, it accompanies well with fruits like pears and apples, nuts, and crusty bread. For a culinary twist, try it melted over polenta or incorporated into risottos for a rich, flavorful depth.",
