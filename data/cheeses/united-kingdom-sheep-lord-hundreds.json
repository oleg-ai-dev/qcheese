This cheese is celebrated for its rich, nutty flavor and firm yet slightly crumbly texture. It typically presents a natural rind that adds to its rustic appearance, with a pale yellow interior that becomes more pronounced as it ages. Lord Hundreds is a testament to the artisanal cheesemaking traditions of the UK, offering a unique taste experience that reflects the quality of the sheep's milk and the skill of the cheesemaker.",
  "history": "Lord Hundreds cheese is a relatively obscure gem within the UK's artisanal cheese scene, reflecting the country's growing interest in high-quality, locally produced cheeses. Its origins are rooted in the tradition of sheep farming and cheesemaking, which has seen a resurgence in recent years as consumers seek out unique and flavorful cheeses. While specific historical details about Lord Hundreds are scarce, it embodies the spirit of British artisanal cheesemaking, showcasing the potential of sheep's milk to produce cheeses with depth and character.",
  "productionProcess": "The production of Lord Hundreds cheese begins with high-quality sheep's milk, which is gently heated before the addition of rennet to initiate curdling. The curds are then cut, stirred, and pressed into molds to form the cheese. After pressing, the cheese is salted and left to age for several months. During this time, it develops its distinctive flavor and texture. The aging process is carefully monitored to ensure the cheese reaches its full potential, with the natural rind forming as it matures.",
  "flavorProfile": "Lord Hundreds cheese boasts a rich, nutty flavor with hints of grassiness, reflecting the quality of the sheep's milk. Its aroma is earthy and inviting, while the texture is firm yet slightly crumbly, offering a satisfying mouthfeel. The cheese's flavor deepens with age, becoming more complex and intense.",
  "pairings": "Lord Hundreds cheese pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and drinks. Traditional pairings include crusty bread, fresh fruits like apples and pears, and nuts. For a more innovative approach, try it with honey or fig jam to complement its nutty flavor. Wine enthusiasts will appreciate its pairing with medium-bodied reds or crisp whites, while beer lovers might enjoy it alongside a hoppy IPA or a smooth stout. Cider also makes an excellent companion, enhancing the cheese's natural flavors.",
