  "history": "Laclare Farms, located in Wisconsin, USA, is renowned for its commitment to producing high-quality, artisanal goat cheeses. The Evalon cheese is a testament to the farm's dedication to traditional cheesemaking techniques, combined with innovative practices. The farm's history is rooted in a passion for sustainable agriculture and the art of cheesemaking, which has been passed down through generations. Evalon was developed as a tribute to the rich cheesemaking heritage of the region, while also showcasing the unique characteristics of goat's milk. This cheese has quickly gained recognition among cheese enthusiasts for its exceptional quality and flavor.",
  "productionProcess": "Evalon is crafted from high-quality goat's milk, sourced from the farm's own herd. The milk is gently pasteurized to ensure safety while preserving the natural flavors. The curdling process involves the addition of traditional rennet, which helps to form a firm curd. The curds are then cut, stirred, and pressed to expel whey, resulting in a semi-hard texture. After pressing, the cheese is aged for several months in a controlled environment, allowing it to develop its distinctive flavor and texture. The aging process is carefully monitored to ensure optimal conditions, contributing to the cheese's unique characteristics.",
  "flavorProfile": "Laclare Farms Evalon offers a complex flavor profile that is both tangy and nutty, with a subtle sweetness that adds depth. The aroma is fresh and slightly earthy, reminiscent of the farm's natural surroundings. The texture is smooth and slightly firm, providing a satisfying mouthfeel. The balance of flavors makes Evalon a versatile cheese that can be enjoyed on its own or as part of a variety of dishes.",
  "pairings": "Evalon pairs beautifully with a range of foods and beverages. For a traditional pairing, try it with a crisp white wine such as Sauvignon Blanc or a light-bodied red like Pinot Noir. Beer enthusiasts might enjoy it with a hoppy IPA or a smooth wheat beer. On the food front, Evalon complements fresh fruits like apples and pears, as well as nuts and honey. It also makes a delightful addition to cheese boards, salads, and sandwiches.",
