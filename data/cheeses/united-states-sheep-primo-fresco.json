  "description": "Primo Fresco is an artisan fresh soft cheese made from sheep's milk, originating from the United States. This cheese is celebrated for its creamy texture and mild, delicate flavor, making it a versatile choice for various culinary applications. Its appearance is typically white and slightly moist, with a soft, spreadable consistency that is perfect for immediate consumption. Primo Fresco stands out for its artisanal quality, reflecting the care and tradition of small-scale cheesemaking. It's a testament to the growing American artisan cheese movement, showcasing the potential for high-quality, locally produced cheeses.",
  "history": "Primo Fresco is a relatively new addition to the American artisan cheese scene, developed by cheesemakers who are passionate about creating high-quality, fresh cheeses from sheep's milk. Its creation is part of a broader trend in the United States towards artisanal and locally sourced foods. While it may not have a long history, Primo Fresco represents the innovation and dedication of American cheesemakers to produce unique and flavorful cheeses. It embodies the spirit of modern American cheesemaking, where tradition meets innovation.",
  "productionProcess": "Primo Fresco is made from high-quality sheep's milk, which is gently pasteurized before the cheesemaking process begins. The milk is then curdled using a specific culture and rennet, allowing the curds to form. These curds are carefully handled to preserve their delicate structure, then lightly pressed and drained to achieve the desired moisture content. Unlike aged cheeses, Primo Fresco is meant to be enjoyed fresh, so it skips the aging process, resulting in a soft, creamy texture and a mild flavor profile.",
  "flavorProfile": "Primo Fresco offers a mild, slightly tangy flavor with a creamy, smooth texture that melts in your mouth. Its aroma is fresh and milky, with subtle hints of the grassy pastures where the sheep graze. The cheese's simplicity and freshness make it a delightful addition to any dish, providing a light, refreshing taste that complements rather than overwhelms.",
  "pairings": "Primo Fresco pairs wonderfully with light, crisp white wines such as Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio, which complement its mild tanginess. For beer enthusiasts, a light pilsner or wheat beer can enhance its creamy texture. It's also excellent with fresh fruits like figs and pears, or drizzled with honey for a sweet and savory treat. Crusty bread, crackers, and a selection of olives make for a perfect cheese board featuring Primo Fresco.",
