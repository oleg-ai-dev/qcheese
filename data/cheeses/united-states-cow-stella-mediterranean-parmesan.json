  "description": "Stella Mediterranean Parmesan is a hard, artisan cheese made from cow's milk, originating from the United States. This cheese is crafted in the style of traditional Italian Parmesan, with a firm texture and a rich, nutty flavor profile. Its appearance is characterized by a natural rind that encases a pale yellow interior, speckled with tiny crystalline structures that contribute to its slightly granular texture. Stella Mediterranean Parmesan is aged for a significant period, which intensifies its flavors and enhances its complexity, making it a versatile cheese for both cooking and direct consumption.",
  "history": "While Stella Mediterranean Parmesan is a relatively modern creation, it draws inspiration from the centuries-old tradition of Parmesan cheese making in Italy. The cheese is produced in the United States, where cheesemakers have adopted and adapted the traditional methods to create a product that pays homage to its Italian roots while incorporating local influences. This cheese represents the growing trend of artisanal cheese production in the U.S., showcasing the ability to produce high-quality, traditional-style cheeses outside of their countries of origin.",
  "productionProcess": "Stella Mediterranean Parmesan is made from high-quality cow's milk, which is carefully selected to ensure the best flavor and texture. The milk is curdled using natural enzymes, and the curds are then cut, cooked, and pressed to expel whey. The cheese is salted and aged for several months to over a year, during which it develops its characteristic hard texture and complex flavors. The aging process is crucial, as it allows the cheese to develop its distinctive nutty and slightly sweet taste, along with a granular texture.",
  "flavorProfile": "Stella Mediterranean Parmesan offers a rich and nutty flavor, with hints of sweetness and a slightly salty finish. Its aroma is intense and inviting, with earthy and fruity notes. The texture is firm and slightly granular, making it perfect for grating over dishes or enjoying in chunks. The cheese's complexity and depth of flavor make it a standout choice for those who appreciate artisanal cheeses.",
  "pairings": "Stella Mediterranean Parmesan pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include full-bodied red wines, such as Chianti or Cabernet Sauvignon, which complement its rich flavors. For a more innovative pairing, try it with a crisp, hoppy IPA to contrast its nuttiness. Accompaniments like honey, figs, and walnuts enhance its sweetness and texture, while crusty bread and olives make for a simple yet satisfying snack. It's also excellent grated over pasta, risottos, and salads for an added depth of flavor.",
