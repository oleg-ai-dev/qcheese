  "description": "Caboc is a traditional Scottish cheese, renowned for its rich history and distinctive characteristics. It is a soft cheese made from cow's milk, notable for its creamy texture and unique appearance. Caboc is often rolled in pinhead oatmeal, giving it a rustic, textured exterior that contrasts beautifully with its smooth, buttery interior. This cheese is celebrated for its indulgent, melt-in-the-mouth quality, making it a favorite among cheese enthusiasts. Its production is deeply rooted in Scottish cheesemaking traditions, embodying the essence of artisanal craftsmanship.",
  "history": "Caboc holds the title of Scotland's oldest known cheese, with its origins tracing back to the 15th century. It was first made by the Clan MacDonald in the Highlands, and its recipe has been passed down through generations, preserving its traditional methods and cultural significance. The cheese's name is derived from the Gaelic word 'cabag', meaning 'little mouthful', reflecting its rich, flavorful profile. Caboc's enduring legacy is a testament to Scotland's rich dairy heritage and its contribution to the world of artisanal cheeses.",
  "productionProcess": "Caboc is made from high-quality cow's milk, which is gently pasteurized before the cheesemaking process begins. The milk is then curdled using a natural starter culture and rennet, allowing the curds to form. These curds are carefully handled to maintain their delicate texture, before being shaped into logs and rolled in pinhead oatmeal. The cheese does not undergo a long aging process, which helps preserve its soft, creamy consistency. The oatmeal coating not only adds a unique texture but also pays homage to Scotland's culinary traditions.",
  "flavorProfile": "Caboc offers a luxurious, buttery flavor with a subtle tanginess that balances its richness. The oatmeal coating introduces a nutty, earthy dimension, enhancing the cheese's overall sensory appeal. Its aroma is mild yet inviting, with hints of fresh cream and a touch of sweetness from the milk. The texture is exceptionally smooth and creamy, making it a delight to savor.",
  "pairings": "Caboc pairs wonderfully with a variety of accompaniments. Traditional pairings include oatcakes, which complement its oatmeal coating, and fresh fruits like apples or pears for a sweet contrast. For beverages, a light, crisp white wine or a smooth Scottish ale can enhance its creamy texture and rich flavors. Innovative pairings might include drizzling it with heather honey or serving it alongside smoked salmon for a truly Scottish experience.",
