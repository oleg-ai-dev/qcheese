  "description": "Sartori Classic Cheese Parmesan is a premium, artisan hard cheese crafted in the United States, embodying the rich tradition of Italian Parmesan with a distinct American twist. Made from cow's milk, this cheese is aged for a minimum of 10 months, developing a firm texture and a rich, nutty flavor profile. Its rind is natural and often bears the marks of its aging process, adding to its artisanal charm. The interior of the cheese is a pale golden color, with a slightly granular texture that is characteristic of well-aged Parmesan. Sartori's commitment to quality and craftsmanship is evident in every bite, making it a standout choice for cheese enthusiasts seeking a domestic alternative to traditional Italian Parmesan.",
  "history": "Sartori Classic Cheese Parmesan is a testament to the Sartori family's dedication to cheesemaking excellence, a tradition that spans over a century in Wisconsin, USA. The Sartori family has been crafting high-quality cheeses since 1939, blending Old World techniques with innovative practices. This Parmesan is a nod to the classic Parmigiano-Reggiano of Italy, adapted to the unique terroir and dairy practices of the United States. It represents a bridge between traditional European cheesemaking and the burgeoning American artisan cheese movement, offering a product that respects its roots while embracing local flavors and ingredients.",
  "productionProcess": "Sartori Classic Cheese Parmesan begins with high-quality cow's milk, sourced from local Wisconsin dairies. The milk is gently heated and combined with rennet to form curds, which are then cut, cooked, and pressed into molds. The cheese wheels are brined to enhance flavor and preserve the cheese, then aged for a minimum of 10 months in carefully controlled environments. During aging, the cheese develops its characteristic hard texture and complex flavor profile. The cheesemakers regularly turn and inspect the wheels to ensure even aging and quality. This meticulous process results in a cheese that is both flavorful and versatile.",
  "flavorProfile": "Sartori Classic Cheese Parmesan boasts a rich, nutty flavor with hints of fruit and a slight tanginess that adds depth to its profile. The aroma is earthy and inviting, with a complexity that unfolds as the cheese ages. Its texture is firm and slightly granular, making it perfect for grating over dishes or enjoying in chunks. The finish is long and satisfying, with a balance of savory and sweet notes that linger on the palate.",
  "pairings": "This Parmesan pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include full-bodied red wines like Chianti or Barolo, which complement its nutty flavor. For a beer pairing, try a malty amber ale or a crisp lager. On the food front, it's excellent shaved over salads, stirred into risottos, or served alongside cured meats and olives on a charcuterie board. For a sweet contrast, pair it with honey or fig jam. Its versatility also makes it a great addition to baked dishes, where it adds depth and richness.",
