  "description": "Aromes Au Gene De Marc is a distinctive semi-soft artisan cheese originating from France, known for its unique infusion with Marc de Bourgogne, a type of grape pomace brandy. This cheese is crafted from a blend of cow and goat milk, offering a complex flavor profile that is both rich and nuanced. Its rind is typically washed with the brandy, which imparts a subtle fruity and earthy aroma, while the interior boasts a creamy, slightly elastic texture. The cheese's appearance is characterized by a rustic, natural rind that may exhibit patches of mold, adding to its artisanal charm. Aromes Au Gene De Marc is celebrated for its ability to balance the boldness of the Marc de Bourgogne with the creamy, tangy notes of the mixed milk base, making it a favorite among cheese connoisseurs seeking something truly unique.",
  "history": "Aromes Au Gene De Marc has its roots in the Burgundy region of France, an area renowned for its winemaking and cheesemaking traditions. The practice of washing cheese rinds with alcohol, particularly Marc de Bourgogne, is a testament to the region's innovative approach to cheesemaking, blending local agricultural products to create distinctive flavors. This cheese is a relatively modern creation, reflecting the contemporary trend of experimenting with traditional methods to produce new and exciting varieties. Its development is a nod to the region's rich history of winemaking, utilizing the byproducts of wine production to enhance the flavor and preservation of cheese.",
  "productionProcess": "The production of Aromes Au Gene De Marc begins with the careful selection of cow and goat milk, which is then pasteurized and inoculated with specific cultures to start the fermentation process. Rennet is added to coagulate the milk, forming curds that are cut, drained, and molded into the desired shape. The cheese is then aged in a controlled environment, during which the rind is periodically washed with Marc de Bourgogne. This washing process not only contributes to the cheese's unique flavor profile but also encourages the growth of beneficial bacteria on the rind, enhancing its complexity. The aging period can vary but typically lasts several weeks to a few months, allowing the flavors to fully develop.",
  "flavorProfile": "Aromes Au Gene De Marc offers a rich and multifaceted flavor profile. The initial taste is creamy and tangy, with a subtle sweetness from the goat milk. The Marc de Bourgogne infusion introduces a fruity and slightly earthy undertone, with a hint of the brandy's warmth. The texture is smooth and slightly elastic, melting pleasantly on the palate. The aroma is complex, with notes of the brandy, earth, and a faint nuttiness, making each bite a sensory exploration.",
  "pairings": "Aromes Au Gene De Marc pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include crusty bread, fresh fruits like pears and apples, and nuts, which complement its creamy texture and complex flavors. For wine enthusiasts, a glass of Burgundy wine or a crisp white wine can enhance the cheese's fruity and earthy notes. Beer lovers might enjoy it with a Belgian ale or a stout, which can stand up to the cheese's bold flavors. For a more innovative approach, try it with dark chocolate or a drizzle of honey for a delightful contrast of flavors.",
