  "description": "Mihalic Peynir is a traditional Turkish cheese, originating from the Marmara region, known for its hard texture and rich flavor. Made exclusively from sheep's milk, this artisan cheese is celebrated for its dense, crumbly texture and a slightly salty, tangy taste that deepens with age. The cheese typically presents a pale yellow to white color, with a natural rind that develops during the aging process. Mihalic Peynir is often compared to other hard, aged cheeses but stands out due to its unique sheep's milk base, which imparts a distinctive richness and complexity.",
  "history": "Mihalic Peynir has a storied history in Turkish cheesemaking, deeply rooted in the pastoral traditions of the Marmara region. This cheese is a testament to the region's rich dairy heritage, where sheep farming has been a way of life for centuries. The name 'Mihalic' is believed to derive from the local dialect, signifying its artisanal and regional character. Over the years, Mihalic Peynir has maintained its status as a cherished local delicacy, often enjoyed in rural households and celebrated in regional festivals. Its production is a craft passed down through generations, embodying the cultural and culinary identity of its homeland.",
  "productionProcess": "The production of Mihalic Peynir begins with the collection of fresh sheep's milk, which is then heated and curdled using natural rennet. The curds are cut, pressed, and molded into the desired shape before being salted and left to age. Aging is a crucial phase, lasting several months, during which the cheese develops its characteristic hard texture and complex flavors. The aging environment, often a cool, humid cellar, plays a significant role in shaping the cheese's final profile. Artisans may also use traditional techniques, such as turning the cheese regularly to ensure even aging and flavor development.",
  "flavorProfile": "Mihalic Peynir offers a robust flavor profile, marked by a harmonious blend of salty, tangy, and slightly nutty notes. The sheep's milk base contributes to a rich, creamy undertone, while the aging process introduces a pleasant sharpness and depth. Its texture is firm and crumbly, making it a delight to savor. The aroma is earthy and inviting, with hints of the pastures where the sheep graze.",
  "pairings": "Mihalic Peynir pairs wonderfully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include crusty bread, olives, and fresh vegetables, which complement its salty tang. For a more innovative approach, try it with honey or fig jam to balance its richness. Wine enthusiasts will appreciate its match with full-bodied reds or crisp whites, while beer lovers might enjoy it alongside a malty ale. For a truly Turkish experience, serve it with a glass of raki, the anise-flavored spirit that cuts through the cheese's richness.",
