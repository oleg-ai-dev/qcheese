  "description": "Comté 18 Months is a celebrated French cheese, originating from the Jura Massif region. It is a hard cheese made exclusively from unpasteurized cow's milk, known for its complex flavor profile and firm, slightly crumbly texture. The cheese boasts a natural, rustic rind that encases a pale yellow interior, indicative of its careful aging process. Comté 18 Months is distinguished by its depth of flavor, which develops over its extended aging period, making it a favorite among cheese connoisseurs.",
  "history": "Comté cheese has a rich history dating back to the Middle Ages, when it was first produced by farmers in the Franche-Comté region of France. The cheese was created as a way to preserve milk during the winter months. Over centuries, Comté has become a symbol of French cheesemaking tradition, with its production strictly regulated by AOC (Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée) guidelines. The 18-month aging variant is particularly prized for its enhanced flavors and textures, a testament to the skill and patience of the affineurs.",
  "productionProcess": "Comté 18 Months is made from the milk of Montbéliarde or French Simmental cows, which graze on the rich pastures of the Jura Massif. The milk is gently heated and curdled using natural rennet. The curds are then cut, pressed into molds, and salted before being aged for a minimum of 18 months in carefully controlled cellars. During this time, the cheese is regularly turned and brushed, allowing it to develop its characteristic flavor and texture.",
  "flavorProfile": "Comté 18 Months offers a rich and nuanced flavor profile, with notes of caramel, nuts, and a slight fruitiness. Its aroma is complex, with hints of earthiness and a subtle sweetness. The texture is firm yet smooth, with a slight granularity that melts beautifully on the palate.",
  "pairings": "Comté 18 Months pairs wonderfully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include crusty bread, dried fruits, and nuts. For wine, opt for a full-bodied red like a Burgundy or a crisp white such as a Chardonnay. Beer enthusiasts might enjoy it with a malty ale or a fruity lambic. For a modern twist, try it with dark chocolate or a drizzle of honey.",
