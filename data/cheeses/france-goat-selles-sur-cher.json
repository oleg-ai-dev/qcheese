  "description": "Selles-sur-Cher is a distinguished French goat cheese, originating from the Loire Valley. It is easily recognizable by its small, flat, cylindrical shape and its distinctive ash-covered rind, which is a blend of charcoal and salt. The interior of the cheese is soft and creamy, with a pure white color that contrasts beautifully with its dark exterior. Selles-sur-Cher is celebrated for its delicate balance of flavors and textures, making it a favorite among cheese connoisseurs. Its production is strictly regulated under the AOC (Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée) designation, ensuring its quality and authenticity.",
  "history": "Selles-sur-Cher has a rich history that dates back to the 19th century in the Berry region of France. It was originally created by local farmers as a way to utilize goat milk, which was abundant in the area. The cheese gained popularity for its unique flavor and preservation qualities, thanks to the ash coating that protects it during aging. Over time, Selles-sur-Cher became a symbol of the Loire Valley's cheesemaking heritage, earning its AOC status in 1975. This recognition has helped preserve traditional methods and ensure the cheese's continued quality and reputation.",
  "productionProcess": "Selles-sur-Cher is made exclusively from whole, raw goat's milk. The milk is gently heated and then curdled using natural rennet. The curds are carefully ladled into molds, allowing the whey to drain naturally. After unmolding, the cheeses are salted and then coated with a fine layer of vegetable ash, which aids in the aging process and contributes to the cheese's distinctive flavor. The cheeses are aged for a minimum of 10 days, during which they develop a soft, creamy texture and a complex flavor profile.",
  "flavorProfile": "Selles-sur-Cher offers a delightful sensory experience. It has a mild, slightly tangy flavor with hints of nuttiness and a subtle earthy undertone from the ash rind. The texture is soft and creamy, yet firm enough to hold its shape. The aroma is fresh and inviting, with a characteristic goat milk scent that is not overpowering. This cheese strikes a perfect balance between richness and lightness, making it a versatile choice for various culinary applications.",
  "pairings": "Selles-sur-Cher pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. It complements fresh fruits like apples and pears, as well as nuts and honey, enhancing its natural flavors. For wine pairings, a crisp Sauvignon Blanc or a light-bodied red like Pinot Noir can elevate the cheese's taste. Beer enthusiasts might enjoy it with a Belgian-style wheat beer. Additionally, it can be served with crusty bread or crackers as part of a cheese platter, offering a delightful contrast in textures.",
