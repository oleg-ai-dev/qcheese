  "productionProcess": "Pongs Extraordinary Cheddar is made from high-quality cow's milk, which is carefully selected to ensure the cheese's rich flavor and texture. The milk is curdled using traditional methods, and the curds are then pressed to remove whey, resulting in a firm cheese. Aging is a crucial part of the process, with the cheese being matured for a significant period to develop its complex flavors. The exact aging time can vary, but it is this careful maturation that gives Pongs Extraordinary Cheddar its distinctive taste and texture.",

The aroma is rich and inviting, with hints of earthiness and a slight nuttiness. On the palate, it offers a smooth, creamy texture that melts away to reveal layers of flavor, including a tangy sharpness that is characteristic of high-quality cheddar. The finish is long and satisfying, leaving a pleasant aftertaste that encourages another bite.",
  "pairings": "Pongs Extraordinary Cheddar pairs wonderfully with a variety of foods and beverages. For a traditional pairing, try it with a slice of crusty bread and a dollop of chutney. It also complements the flavors of apples and pears, making it a great addition to a cheese board. When it comes to drinks, a full-bodied red wine or a crisp cider can enhance the cheese's flavors. For a more adventurous pairing, consider a craft beer with hoppy notes to contrast the cheese's richness.",
