  "description": "Midnight Moon is a captivating hard cheese made from goat's milk, originating from Holland but crafted in the United States by Cypress Grove. This cheese is known for its smooth, firm texture and a pale ivory color that deepens to a golden hue as it ages. Its rind is natural and often coated with a light layer of wax to preserve its quality. Midnight Moon stands out for its rich, nutty flavor with hints of caramel and brown butter, making it a favorite among cheese enthusiasts. Its aging process, typically around six months, allows it to develop a complex flavor profile that is both sophisticated and approachable.",
  "history": "Midnight Moon was developed by Cypress Grove, a renowned American cheesemaker, in collaboration with Dutch cheesemakers. This partnership combines traditional Dutch cheesemaking techniques with Cypress Grove's innovative approach to create a unique cheese that bridges cultures. While its roots are in Holland, its production in the United States has made it a staple in American artisanal cheese markets. Midnight Moon reflects the growing appreciation for goat cheese in the U.S. and showcases the versatility of goat's milk in producing aged, hard cheeses.",
  "productionProcess": "Midnight Moon is made from high-quality goat's milk, which is pasteurized before the cheesemaking process begins. The milk is curdled using microbial rennet, and the curds are pressed to remove whey, resulting in a dense texture. The cheese is then aged for approximately six months in a controlled environment, allowing it to develop its signature nutty and caramel flavors. The aging process is crucial, as it enhances the cheese's complexity and smoothness. The final product is coated with a light layer of wax to maintain its moisture and flavor.",
  "flavorProfile": "Midnight Moon offers a rich, nutty flavor with delightful notes of caramel and brown butter. Its aroma is subtly sweet and earthy, complementing its smooth, firm texture. The cheese has a lingering finish that balances sweetness and savory notes, making it a versatile choice for various culinary applications.",
  "pairings": "Midnight Moon pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. For a classic pairing, try it with a glass of Chardonnay or a Belgian-style ale to complement its nutty and caramel notes. On a cheese board, it pairs well with dried fruits like apricots or figs, and nuts such as almonds or walnuts. For a savory option, serve it with crusty bread and a drizzle of honey. It also works wonderfully in salads or melted over roasted vegetables for a gourmet touch.",
