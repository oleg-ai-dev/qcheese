  "description": "Burrata is a fresh, soft cheese that originates from Italy, specifically the Apulia region, and has gained popularity in the United States. It is made from water buffalo milk, though cow's milk versions are also common. The cheese is known for its unique structure: a solid outer shell of mozzarella that encases a creamy, buttery interior of stracciatella and cream. This combination gives Burrata its distinctive texture and appearance, making it a luxurious addition to any dish. Its delicate, milky flavor and soft, spreadable texture make it a favorite among cheese enthusiasts.",
  "history": "Burrata was first created in the early 20th century on the Bianchini farm in the city of Andria, Apulia, as a way to utilize the leftover scraps from mozzarella production. The name 'Burrata' means 'buttered' in Italian, reflecting its rich, creamy interior. Initially, it was a local delicacy, wrapped in asphodel leaves to indicate its freshness. Over time, its popularity spread beyond Italy, and today, it is celebrated worldwide for its artisanal quality and unique taste. Its production has also expanded to the United States, where it is made using traditional Italian methods.",
  "productionProcess": "Burrata is made by stretching fresh mozzarella curds into a thin sheet, which is then filled with a mixture of stracciatella (shredded mozzarella) and fresh cream. The filled mozzarella is then sealed to form a pouch, creating the cheese's signature structure. The process requires skilled craftsmanship to ensure the outer shell is firm enough to hold the creamy filling while remaining tender. The cheese is typically consumed fresh, within 48 hours of production, to preserve its delicate flavor and texture.",
  "flavorProfile": "Burrata offers a luxurious, creamy texture with a rich, buttery flavor. The outer mozzarella shell is mild and slightly elastic, while the interior is soft, velvety, and decadent. Its aroma is fresh and milky, with a subtle tanginess that complements its sweetness. The cheese melts in the mouth, leaving a lingering richness that is both satisfying and indulgent.",
  "pairings": "Burrata pairs beautifully with fresh, seasonal ingredients. It is often served with ripe tomatoes, basil, and a drizzle of olive oil for a classic Caprese salad. It also complements roasted vegetables, crusty bread, and cured meats like prosciutto. For beverages, light white wines such as Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc enhance its creamy texture, while sparkling wines like Prosecco add a refreshing contrast. Craft beers with citrusy or floral notes also work well.",
