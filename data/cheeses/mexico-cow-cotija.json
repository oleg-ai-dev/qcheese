  "description": "Cotija cheese is a traditional Mexican cheese known for its hard texture and salty flavor, reminiscent of Parmesan. Originating from the town of Cotija in the state of Michoacán, this cheese is made from cow's milk and is aged for several months to develop its distinctive taste and crumbly texture. Cotija is often used as a topping or garnish in Mexican cuisine, adding a salty, tangy flavor to dishes. Its appearance is typically white, with a firm and dry texture that allows it to be easily grated or crumbled over food.",
  "history": "Cotija cheese has its roots in the town of Cotija, Michoacán, Mexico, where it has been produced for centuries. Named after its place of origin, Cotija cheese is a staple in Mexican cuisine, often referred to as the 'Parmesan of Mexico' due to its similar texture and use as a grating cheese. Its production is deeply tied to the region's dairy farming traditions, where local artisans have passed down cheesemaking techniques through generations. Cotija plays a significant role in Mexican culinary culture, especially in dishes that require a bold, salty flavor.",
  "productionProcess": "Cotija cheese is made from cow's milk, which is curdled using rennet or a similar enzyme. The curds are then pressed to remove whey, resulting in a firm cheese. After pressing, the cheese is salted and left to age for several months. The aging process is crucial for developing Cotija's hard texture and intense flavor. Artisans may use traditional methods, such as aging the cheese in cool, humid cellars, to enhance its characteristics. The final product is a dry, crumbly cheese that can be easily grated or crumbled.",
  "flavorProfile": "Cotija cheese is known for its strong, salty flavor with a slightly tangy and milky undertone. Its aroma is pungent and earthy, reflecting its aging process. The texture is hard and crumbly, making it ideal for grating or crumbling over dishes. The flavor intensifies with age, offering a robust taste that can elevate a variety of culinary creations.",
  "pairings": "Cotija cheese pairs well with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditionally, it is used as a topping for tacos, tostadas, and salads, adding a salty kick. It also complements corn-based dishes like elote (Mexican street corn). For drinks, try pairing Cotija with a crisp lager or a light-bodied red wine like Tempranillo. For a non-alcoholic option, a tangy limeade or horchata can balance the cheese's saltiness. Cotija also works well in fusion dishes, such as pasta or risotto, where its bold flavor can stand out.",
