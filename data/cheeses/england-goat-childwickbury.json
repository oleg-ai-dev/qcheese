  "productionProcess": "Childwickbury cheese is produced using fresh goat's milk, which is carefully selected for its quality and flavor. The milk undergoes a gentle curdling process, often involving the addition of natural cultures and rennet to achieve the desired texture and acidity.

Aging is minimal, as Childwickbury is a fresh cheese, designed to be enjoyed soon after production to capture its vibrant flavors and creamy texture.",

Its aroma is fresh and slightly earthy, characteristic of goat's milk cheeses. The taste is clean and refreshing, with a subtle complexity that makes it a favorite among cheese enthusiasts.",
  "pairings": "Childwickbury cheese pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. For a traditional pairing, enjoy it with crisp white wines or light, floral beers that complement its tangy flavor. It also pairs well with fresh fruits, such as grapes or figs, and crusty bread for a simple yet elegant snack. For a more innovative approach, incorporate Childwickbury into salads or use it as a creamy topping for bruschetta, enhancing dishes with its unique flavor and texture.",
