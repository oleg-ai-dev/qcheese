  "description": "Barely Buzzed is a unique artisan cheese hailing from the United States, specifically crafted by the Beehive Cheese Company in Utah. This hard cheese is made from cow's milk and is renowned for its distinctive rind, which is hand-rubbed with a blend of finely ground coffee and lavender. The result is a cheese with a striking appearance, featuring a dark, espresso-colored rind that contrasts beautifully with the pale, creamy interior. The texture of Barely Buzzed is firm yet yielding, with a smooth, buttery consistency that melts delightfully on the palate. Its unique flavor profile, influenced by the coffee and lavender infusion, makes it a standout choice for cheese enthusiasts seeking something out of the ordinary.",
  "history": "Barely Buzzed was created by the Beehive Cheese Company, a small artisan cheesemaker based in Utah, known for their innovative approach to traditional cheesemaking. The cheese was developed as part of their mission to create unique, handcrafted cheeses that push the boundaries of flavor. The inspiration for Barely Buzzed came from the desire to combine the rich, robust flavors of coffee with the delicate, floral notes of lavender, resulting in a cheese that is as intriguing as it is delicious. Since its introduction, Barely Buzzed has gained a cult following among cheese lovers and has been recognized with numerous awards for its exceptional quality and creativity.",
  "productionProcess": "Barely Buzzed begins with high-quality cow's milk, which is carefully selected to ensure the best possible base for the cheese. The milk is pasteurized and then cultured with specific bacteria to develop the cheese's flavor. Rennet is added to coagulate the milk, forming curds that are cut, stirred, and pressed to expel whey. The cheese is then aged for several months, during which time it develops its firm texture and complex flavors. The unique aspect of Barely Buzzed's production is the hand-rubbing of its rind with a mixture of finely ground coffee and lavender, which imparts the cheese's signature aroma and taste. This meticulous process ensures that each wheel of Barely Buzzed is a masterpiece of artisan cheesemaking.",
  "flavorProfile": "Barely Buzzed offers a complex and captivating flavor profile that begins with the rich, earthy notes of coffee, complemented by the subtle, floral undertones of lavender. The cheese itself has a creamy, buttery texture that balances the boldness of the rind, with a nutty, slightly sweet finish. The interplay of flavors creates a harmonious blend that is both unexpected and delightful, making Barely Buzzed a memorable experience for the palate.",
  "pairings": "Barely Buzzed pairs wonderfully with a variety of foods and beverages. For a traditional pairing, try it with a bold red wine like Cabernet Sauvignon or a rich, malty beer such as a stout or porter, which complement the coffee notes in the cheese. For a more adventurous pairing, serve Barely Buzzed with dark chocolate or a fig jam to enhance its sweet and savory elements. On a cheese board, it pairs beautifully with crusty bread, nuts, and fresh or dried fruits. For a culinary twist, incorporate Barely Buzzed into a gourmet grilled cheese sandwich or use it to add depth to a savory bread pudding.",
