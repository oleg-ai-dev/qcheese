  "description": "Cerney Pyramid is a distinctive artisan cheese hailing from the Cotswolds in England. This cheese is made from goat's milk and is known for its unique pyramid shape, which is not only visually appealing but also a nod to traditional cheesemaking techniques. The rind is dusted with vegetable ash, giving it a striking appearance and a subtle, earthy flavor. The texture of Cerney Pyramid is soft and creamy, making it a luxurious treat for cheese lovers. Its fresh, tangy flavor is complemented by a slight nuttiness, making it a versatile cheese for various culinary applications.",
  "history": "Cerney Pyramid was created by Lady Angus, who started making cheese in the 1980s on her estate in the Cotswolds. Inspired by the French Valençay cheese, she aimed to produce a cheese that reflected the quality and tradition of English cheesemaking. The pyramid shape and ash coating are traditional techniques that have been revived to create a cheese that is both visually stunning and delicious. Over the years, Cerney Pyramid has gained a reputation as one of England's finest artisan cheeses, celebrated for its unique shape and flavor.",
  "productionProcess": "Cerney Pyramid is made from pasteurized goat's milk, which is curdled using traditional methods. The curds are then gently ladled into pyramid-shaped molds, a process that requires skill and precision to maintain the cheese's distinctive shape. After molding, the cheese is dusted with vegetable ash, which helps to develop the rind and adds a subtle flavor. The cheese is aged for a short period, typically around two to three weeks, to allow the flavors to develop while maintaining its fresh, soft texture.",
  "flavorProfile": "Cerney Pyramid offers a delightful balance of flavors. The initial taste is fresh and tangy, characteristic of goat's milk cheeses, with a creamy, smooth texture that melts in the mouth. The ash coating adds a slight earthiness and complexity to the flavor profile. The cheese has a mild aroma, with hints of citrus and herbs, making it a refreshing choice for cheese boards and culinary dishes.",
  "pairings": "Cerney Pyramid pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. For a traditional pairing, try it with a crisp white wine such as Sauvignon Blanc or a light, fruity red like Pinot Noir. It also complements sparkling wines and dry ciders. On the food side, Cerney Pyramid is excellent with fresh fruits like apples and pears, as well as with nuts and honey. For a more adventurous pairing, try it with a drizzle of truffle oil or alongside a selection of charcuterie.",
