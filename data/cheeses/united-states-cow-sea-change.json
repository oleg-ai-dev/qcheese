Its rind may vary in appearance, often showcasing natural molds that contribute to its complex flavor profile.

  "history": "Sea Change cheese is a relatively new addition to the American artisanal cheese scene, embodying the innovative spirit of modern cheesemaking in the United States. While specific historical details about Sea Change are scarce, it represents the growing trend of small-scale, craft cheese producers who are experimenting with traditional techniques to create unique and flavorful cheeses. This cheese is a testament to the creativity and passion of American cheesemakers, who are increasingly recognized on the global stage for their high-quality, artisanal products.",
  "productionProcess": "Sea Change cheese is produced using high-quality cow's milk, which is carefully selected to ensure the best flavor and texture. The milk undergoes a gentle pasteurization process before being inoculated with specific cultures to start the fermentation. Rennet is then added to coagulate the milk, forming curds that are cut, drained, and pressed into molds. The cheese is aged for a period that allows it to develop its characteristic semi-soft texture and complex flavors. During aging, the cheese may be treated with natural molds that contribute to its unique rind and taste profile.",
  "flavorProfile": "Sea Change cheese offers a rich and complex flavor profile, with a perfect balance of tangy and buttery notes. Its aroma is inviting, with hints of earthiness and a slight sharpness that complements its creamy texture. The cheese's semi-soft consistency makes it a versatile choice for various culinary applications, providing a satisfying mouthfeel that is both smooth and slightly firm.",
  "pairings": "Sea Change cheese pairs wonderfully with a variety of foods and beverages. For a traditional pairing, enjoy it with crusty bread, fresh fruits like apples and pears, and a selection of nuts. It also complements charcuterie meats such as prosciutto and salami. In terms of beverages, Sea Change goes well with medium-bodied red wines, crisp white wines, and craft beers that have a balanced bitterness. For a unique twist, try it with a glass of sparkling cider or a light, floral tea.",
