  "description": "St Tola Greek Style cheese is a unique Irish cheese that draws inspiration from traditional Greek cheeses. Made from goat's milk, it is firm and brined, offering a distinctive texture and flavor profile that sets it apart from other goat cheeses. Its appearance is typically white with a slightly crumbly yet smooth texture, making it versatile for various culinary applications. The cheese is known for its tangy and slightly salty taste, with a creamy finish that lingers on the palate. It's a testament to the innovative spirit of Irish cheesemaking, blending traditional techniques with international influences.",
  "history": "St Tola Greek Style cheese originates from the St Tola Goat Farm in County Clare, Ireland. The farm has been at the forefront of artisanal cheese production since the 1970s, focusing on sustainable farming and high-quality goat's milk products. The Greek Style cheese was developed as a nod to the rich cheesemaking traditions of Greece, particularly the brined cheeses like Feta. It represents a fusion of Irish and Greek culinary traditions, showcasing the versatility and creativity of modern cheesemaking. This cheese has gained popularity for its unique flavor and texture, contributing to the diversity of Irish artisanal cheeses.",
  "productionProcess": "St Tola Greek Style cheese is made from pasteurized goat's milk, which is curdled using traditional rennet. The curds are then cut, drained, and pressed into molds to form the cheese. After molding, the cheese undergoes a brining process, which is crucial for developing its characteristic flavor and texture. The brining solution typically contains salt and water, and the cheese is left to soak for several days. This process not only flavors the cheese but also helps to preserve it. Finally, the cheese is aged for a short period to allow the flavors to mature, resulting in a firm yet creamy texture.",
  "flavorProfile": "St Tola Greek Style cheese boasts a tangy and slightly salty flavor profile, with a creamy finish that is both refreshing and satisfying. The aroma is fresh and inviting, with subtle hints of goat's milk. Its texture is firm yet crumbly, allowing it to melt beautifully when heated. The brining process imparts a unique savoriness that complements the natural tanginess of the goat's milk, making it a versatile cheese for both cooking and direct consumption.",
  "pairings": "St Tola Greek Style cheese pairs wonderfully with crisp white wines such as Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio, which complement its tangy flavor. For beer enthusiasts, a light pilsner or wheat beer can enhance its creamy texture. It also goes well with fresh fruits like grapes and figs, as well as nuts and olives, making it a great addition to cheese boards. For a more substantial pairing, try it in salads or alongside grilled vegetables to add a burst of flavor.",
