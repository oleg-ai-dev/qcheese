  "history": "Stella Goat cheese is a relatively modern addition to the American artisan cheese scene, reflecting the growing interest in high-quality, locally produced cheeses. While specific historical details about Stella Goat are scarce, it is part of a broader movement in the United States towards artisanal and farmstead cheeses, particularly those made from goat's milk. This movement has been driven by a desire to explore traditional cheesemaking techniques and to offer consumers a wider variety of cheese options. Stella Goat cheese embodies this trend, showcasing the skill and creativity of American cheesemakers.",
  "productionProcess": "Stella Goat cheese is made from 100% goat's milk, which is pasteurized before the cheesemaking process begins. The milk is then curdled using a combination of heat and rennet, a traditional method that helps to separate the curds from the whey. After curdling, the curds are pressed to remove excess moisture, contributing to the cheese's semi-hard texture. The cheese is then aged for several months, during which it develops its characteristic flavor and texture. The aging process is carefully monitored to ensure the cheese achieves the perfect balance of tanginess and creaminess.",
  "flavorProfile": "Stella Goat cheese offers a delightful balance of flavors, with a slightly tangy and earthy taste that is typical of goat cheeses. It has a creamy, smooth texture that melts in the mouth, leaving a pleasant, lingering aftertaste. The cheese's aroma is mild and inviting, with subtle hints of the grassy pastures where the goats graze. Its flavor complexity makes it a favorite among those who appreciate the nuanced profiles of artisan cheeses.",
  "pairings": "Stella Goat cheese pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. For a classic pairing, serve it with crisp white wines such as Sauvignon Blanc or a light-bodied Pinot Noir, which complement its tangy flavor. It also goes well with craft beers, especially those with a citrusy or hoppy profile. On the food side, Stella Goat cheese is excellent with fresh fruits like pears and apples, nuts, and honey for a sweet and savory contrast. It can also be incorporated into salads, sandwiches, and pasta dishes for added depth of flavor.",
