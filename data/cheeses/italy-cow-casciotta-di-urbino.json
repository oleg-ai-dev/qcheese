  "description": "Casciotta Di Urbino is a semi-soft, artisan cheese originating from the Marche region of Italy, specifically around the city of Urbino. This cheese is unique for its blend of cow's and sheep's milk, typically in a 70:30 ratio, which contributes to its distinctive flavor and texture. It has a pale yellow interior with a thin, natural rind that may develop a slight bloom as it ages. The texture is creamy and slightly crumbly, making it versatile for various culinary uses. Casciotta Di Urbino is celebrated for its delicate balance of flavors, which are a testament to the rich pastoral traditions of its region.",
  "history": "Casciotta Di Urbino has a storied history that dates back to the Renaissance period, where it was highly regarded by the nobility, including the Duke of Urbino. Its production is deeply rooted in the pastoral traditions of the Marche region, where the combination of cow's and sheep's milk reflects the agricultural practices of the area. The cheese gained Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status in 1996, recognizing its unique characteristics and traditional production methods. This status helps preserve the cheese's heritage and ensures that it continues to be made according to time-honored practices.",
  "productionProcess": "The production of Casciotta Di Urbino begins with the careful selection of cow's and sheep's milk, which is then gently heated and curdled using natural rennet. The curds are cut, drained, and placed into molds, where they are pressed to remove excess whey. The cheese is then salted and aged for a short period, typically 20 to 30 days, in cool, humid cellars. This brief aging process allows the cheese to develop its characteristic semi-soft texture and subtle flavors without becoming too sharp or hard.",
  "flavorProfile": "Casciotta Di Urbino offers a delicate and nuanced flavor profile, with a balance of sweet and tangy notes derived from the blend of cow's and sheep's milk. The aroma is mild and slightly earthy, with hints of fresh grass and nuts. Its texture is creamy yet crumbly, providing a pleasant mouthfeel that complements its subtle flavors. The cheese's mildness makes it accessible to a wide range of palates, while its complexity offers depth for more discerning cheese lovers.",
  "pairings": "Casciotta Di Urbino pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include light, fruity white wines such as Verdicchio, which complement the cheese's delicate flavors. For beer enthusiasts, a crisp pilsner or a light ale can enhance the cheese's creamy texture. On the food side, it works wonderfully with fresh fruits like pears and apples, as well as with honey and nuts for a sweet and savory contrast. It's also a great addition to salads, offering a creamy texture and mild flavor that doesn't overpower other ingredients.",
