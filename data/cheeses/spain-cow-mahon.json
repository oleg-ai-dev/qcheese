  "description": "Mahon cheese, a semi-hard, artisan cheese from the island of Menorca in Spain, is celebrated for its distinctive flavor and texture. Made exclusively from cow's milk, it boasts a firm yet creamy texture that can vary depending on its aging period. The cheese is easily recognizable by its square shape and orange rind, which is a result of being rubbed with butter or oil and sometimes paprika during the aging process. Mahon's interior ranges from pale yellow to deep amber, with small, irregular holes scattered throughout. Its unique characteristics are influenced by the salty sea breezes of the Mediterranean, which contribute to the cheese's maturation and flavor development.",
  "history": "Mahon cheese has a rich history that dates back to the time of the Roman Empire, making it one of the oldest cheeses in Spain. Named after the port city of Mahon, the capital of Menorca, it has been a staple of the island's diet and culture for centuries. The cheese's production was traditionally a way to preserve milk in a region where the climate and geography made fresh milk consumption challenging. Over time, Mahon cheese gained recognition beyond Menorca, becoming a symbol of the island's heritage and culinary tradition. Its Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status, awarded in 1985, ensures that only cheese produced in Menorca following traditional methods can bear the Mahon name.",
  "productionProcess": "The production of Mahon cheese begins with the pasteurization of cow's milk, followed by the addition of rennet to coagulate the milk. The curd is then cut, heated, and pressed into molds, giving the cheese its characteristic square shape. After molding, the cheese is salted, either by dry salting or brining, and then aged for a minimum of two months. During aging, the cheese is regularly turned and rubbed with butter, oil, or paprika, which contributes to the development of its rind and flavor. The aging process can vary from a few months to over a year, resulting in a range of textures and flavors from mild and creamy to sharp and crumbly.",
  "flavorProfile": "Mahon cheese offers a complex flavor profile that evolves with age. Younger cheeses are mild, buttery, and slightly tangy, with a smooth and creamy texture. As the cheese ages, it develops a more pronounced flavor, becoming nuttier, sharper, and slightly salty, with a firmer, crumblier texture. The aroma is fresh and milky in younger cheeses, becoming more intense and earthy with age. The unique influence of the Mediterranean climate imparts a subtle briny note, distinguishing Mahon from other cow's milk cheeses.",
  "pairings": "Mahon cheese pairs wonderfully with a variety of foods and beverages. For a traditional pairing, enjoy it with crusty bread, olives, and a glass of full-bodied red wine, such as a Tempranillo or a Rioja. It also complements white wines like Albariño or a crisp cider. For a more innovative approach, try Mahon with dark chocolate or fruit preserves for a delightful contrast of flavors. In terms of beer, a malty amber ale or a hoppy IPA can stand up to the cheese's robust flavors. Mahon is also excellent in cooking, adding depth to dishes like salads, pastas, and grilled sandwiches.",
