  "description": "Coupole is a soft, artisan goat cheese originating from the United States, specifically crafted by the Vermont Creamery. This cheese is distinguished by its unique dome shape, resembling a small, snow-covered hill, which is where it gets its name ('coupole' means 'dome' in French). The rind is bloomy and edible, offering a slightly wrinkled, white appearance that encases a creamy, smooth interior. Coupole is celebrated for its delicate balance of tanginess and richness, making it a favorite among cheese enthusiasts. Its texture is luxuriously soft and spreadable, yet it holds its shape well, making it versatile for various culinary applications.",
  "history": "Coupole cheese is a testament to the innovation and craftsmanship of American cheesemaking, particularly within the Vermont Creamery, which has been at the forefront of producing high-quality, artisanal cheeses since the 1980s. Inspired by traditional French cheesemaking techniques, Coupole was developed to showcase the unique qualities of goat milk, offering a domestic alternative to classic French goat cheeses. Its creation reflects a broader movement in the United States towards artisanal and locally sourced foods, with Vermont Creamery playing a pivotal role in elevating goat cheese to a staple of American cheese boards.",
  "productionProcess": "Coupole is made from pasteurized goat milk, which is gently curdled using microbial rennet. The curds are then carefully ladled into molds to preserve their delicate structure, a technique that contributes to the cheese's soft texture. After molding, the cheese is aged for about two weeks, during which it develops its characteristic bloomy rind. The aging process is crucial for developing the cheese's flavor profile and texture, allowing it to achieve the perfect balance of creaminess and tanginess. The result is a cheese that is both complex in flavor and approachable in texture.",
  "flavorProfile": "Coupole offers a delightful flavor profile that is tangy, with a hint of earthiness and a creamy, buttery finish. The aroma is fresh and slightly floral, characteristic of high-quality goat cheese. Its texture is smooth and spreadable, with a slight firmness that makes it versatile for both spreading and slicing. The edible rind adds a subtle mushroomy note, enhancing the overall sensory experience.",
  "pairings": "Coupole pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. For a classic pairing, serve it with crusty bread, fresh fruits like pears or apples, and a drizzle of honey to complement its tanginess. It also pairs well with light, crisp white wines such as Sauvignon Blanc or a dry Rosé, which can balance its creamy texture. For beer enthusiasts, a Belgian-style Witbier offers a refreshing contrast to the cheese's richness. Additionally, Coupole can be incorporated into salads, adding a creamy element to greens dressed with a vinaigrette.",
