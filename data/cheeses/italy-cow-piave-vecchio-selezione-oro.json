  "description": "Piave Vecchio Selezione Oro is a distinguished hard cheese from the Dolomites region in Belluno, Italy, crafted exclusively from the milk of cows grazing in the lush pastures of the Piave River valley. This artisan cheese is aged for over 12 months, developing a dense, compact texture and a deep golden color. Its rind is hard and natural, often bearing the marks of the cheesecloth used during its production. Piave Vecchio Selezione Oro is celebrated for its complex flavor profile, which intensifies with age, offering a delightful balance between sweetness and a slightly piquant finish. Its unique characteristics and artisanal quality make it a prized selection among cheese connoisseurs.",
  "history": "Piave Vecchio Selezione Oro has its roots deeply embedded in the rich cheesemaking traditions of the Belluno province in the Veneto region of Italy. Named after the Piave River, which flows through the area, this cheese is a testament to the region's dedication to preserving traditional methods of cheese production. The Selezione Oro variant represents the pinnacle of aging, selected for its superior quality and flavor. Over the years, Piave Vecchio has gained recognition not only in Italy but internationally, symbolizing the artisanal excellence and the unique terroir of its origin.",
  "productionProcess": "Piave Vecchio Selezione Oro is made from pasteurized cow's milk, sourced from local farms in the Belluno province. The milk is curdled using natural rennet, and the curds are then cooked and pressed to form the cheese. After molding, the cheese undergoes a brining process, which contributes to its flavor and preservation. The aging process lasts for over 12 months in carefully controlled environments, allowing the cheese to develop its characteristic texture and depth of flavor. The Selezione Oro is hand-selected based on its quality and aging potential, ensuring a product of exceptional standard.",
  "flavorProfile": "Piave Vecchio Selezione Oro offers a rich and complex flavor profile, with a harmonious blend of sweet and nutty notes, complemented by a slightly piquant finish. Its aroma is intense and inviting, with hints of toasted nuts and a subtle earthiness. The texture is firm and grainy, yet it melts smoothly, releasing its full-bodied flavors. This cheese's depth and complexity make it a memorable experience for the palate.",
  "pairings": "Piave Vecchio Selezione Oro pairs wonderfully with full-bodied red wines such as Amarone or Barolo, which complement its rich flavors. It also goes well with craft beers, particularly those with a malty profile. For a traditional pairing, serve it with honey, figs, or walnuts to enhance its sweetness and nuttiness. It can also be grated over risottos or pasta dishes, adding depth and complexity to the meal.",
