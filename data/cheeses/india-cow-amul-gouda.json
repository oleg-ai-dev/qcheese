  "description": "Amul Gouda is a semi-hard cheese originating from India, crafted from cow's milk. It is known for its smooth, creamy texture and a mild, slightly sweet flavor that becomes more pronounced with age. The cheese has a pale yellow color and a firm yet pliable consistency, making it versatile for various culinary uses. Amul Gouda is often encased in a wax coating to preserve its freshness and flavor. It is a testament to the global influence of Dutch cheesemaking traditions, adapted to local tastes and production capabilities in India.",
  "history": "Amul Gouda is a product of Amul, a dairy cooperative based in India that has been at the forefront of the country's White Revolution, aimed at making India self-sufficient in milk production. Inspired by the traditional Dutch Gouda, Amul introduced its version to cater to the growing demand for international cheese varieties among Indian consumers. While it does not have the centuries-old history of its Dutch counterpart, Amul Gouda represents the fusion of global cheesemaking techniques with India's rich dairy heritage, making it a unique addition to the world of cheese.",
  "productionProcess": "Amul Gouda is made from pasteurized cow's milk, which is curdled using microbial rennet. The curds are then pressed into molds and brined to develop flavor and texture. After brining, the cheese is aged for several weeks to months, during which it develops its characteristic mild to medium flavor profile. The aging process also affects the cheese's texture, making it firmer over time. The final product is coated in wax to protect it during storage and transportation.",
  "flavorProfile": "Amul Gouda offers a mild, buttery, and slightly sweet flavor with a smooth, creamy texture. As it ages, the cheese develops a more complex flavor profile, with hints of nuttiness and a firmer texture. Its aroma is subtle, with a pleasant milky scent that complements its taste.",
  "pairings": "Amul Gouda pairs well with a variety of foods and beverages. It complements fruits like apples and pears, and is excellent with nuts and whole grain bread. For drinks, it goes well with light beers, crisp white wines, and even Indian chai. Its versatility also makes it a great addition to cheese platters, sandwiches, and baked dishes.",
