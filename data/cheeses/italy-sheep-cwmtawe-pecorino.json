  "description": "Cwmtawe Pecorino is a hard cheese made from sheep's milk, originating from Italy. This cheese is known for its firm texture and rich, nutty flavor, which becomes more pronounced with age. The rind is typically natural, sometimes treated with olive oil to preserve it, giving it a rustic appearance. Cwmtawe Pecorino is aged for several months, allowing it to develop a complex flavor profile that includes hints of grass and herbs, reflective of the sheep's diet. Its texture is granular yet smooth, making it ideal for grating over dishes or enjoying on its own.",
  "history": "Pecorino cheeses have a long history in Italy, with each region offering its own variation. Cwmtawe Pecorino, while not as widely documented as some of its counterparts, is part of this rich tradition. Sheep farming has been a staple in Italian agriculture for centuries, and Pecorino cheeses were developed as a way to preserve the milk. Cwmtawe Pecorino continues this tradition, embodying the pastoral heritage of its region. Its production is a testament to the artisanal cheesemaking skills passed down through generations.",
  "productionProcess": "Cwmtawe Pecorino is made from whole sheep's milk, which is heated and then curdled using natural rennet. The curds are cut, cooked, and then pressed into molds to form the cheese. After unmolding, the cheese is salted, either by brining or dry salting, and then aged for several months. During aging, the cheese is regularly turned and sometimes rubbed with olive oil to protect the rind and encourage the development of flavor. The aging process is crucial for developing the cheese's characteristic texture and taste.",
  "flavorProfile": "Cwmtawe Pecorino offers a rich and nutty flavor with a slightly tangy finish. The aroma is earthy and complex, with notes of grass and herbs. As it ages, the cheese develops a sharper taste and a more granular texture, making it a favorite among those who appreciate bold flavors. The sheep's milk imparts a distinctive richness that sets it apart from cow's milk cheeses.",
  "pairings": "Cwmtawe Pecorino pairs beautifully with full-bodied red wines, such as Chianti or Barolo, which complement its robust flavor. For a lighter option, try it with a crisp white wine or a fruity beer. On the food side, it goes well with honey, figs, and walnuts for a delightful contrast of flavors. It's also excellent grated over pasta dishes or incorporated into risottos for added depth.",
