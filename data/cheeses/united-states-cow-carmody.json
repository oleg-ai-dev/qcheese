  "description": "Carmody cheese is a semi-hard, artisan cheese originating from the United States, specifically crafted by Bellwether Farms in Sonoma County, California. Made from cow's milk, it boasts a smooth, creamy texture and a pale yellow interior with a natural, edible rind. Its unique characteristics include a delicate balance of buttery and tangy flavors, making it a versatile choice for various culinary applications. Carmody is aged for about 60 days, allowing it to develop a subtle complexity without overwhelming the palate.",
  "history": "Carmody cheese was developed by Bellwether Farms, a pioneer in American artisan cheesemaking, known for its commitment to sustainable practices and high-quality dairy products. Named after a local dairy farmer, Carmody represents the fusion of traditional European cheesemaking techniques with California's innovative spirit. It has gained recognition for its approachable flavor and artisanal quality, contributing to the growing appreciation of American-made cheeses.",
  "productionProcess": "Carmody cheese begins with high-quality, pasteurized cow's milk, sourced from local, sustainable farms. The milk is gently heated and coagulated using microbial rennet, forming a curd that is then cut, stirred, and pressed into molds. After being unmolded, the cheese is brined to enhance flavor and texture. It is aged for approximately 60 days in a controlled environment, where it develops its characteristic rind and flavor profile. The careful aging process ensures a perfect balance of moisture and firmness.",
  "flavorProfile": "Carmody cheese offers a delightful sensory experience with its creamy, smooth texture and a flavor profile that combines buttery richness with a hint of tanginess. The aroma is mild and inviting, with subtle earthy notes from the natural rind. Its balanced taste makes it a favorite among both cheese connoisseurs and casual enthusiasts.",
  "pairings": "Carmody cheese pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. For a traditional pairing, enjoy it with crusty bread, fresh fruits like apples and pears, and a glass of Chardonnay or Pinot Noir. It also complements craft beers, particularly those with a malty profile. For a more innovative approach, try it in a grilled cheese sandwich with caramelized onions or as a topping for a gourmet burger. Its versatility makes it a star on cheese boards, alongside nuts, honey, and artisanal crackers.",
