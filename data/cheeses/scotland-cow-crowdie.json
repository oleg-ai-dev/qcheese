  "description": "Crowdie is a traditional Scottish fresh cheese made from cow's milk, known for its simple, rustic charm. It has a soft, crumbly texture and a mild, slightly tangy flavor that reflects its fresh nature. This cheese is often compared to cottage cheese or fromage frais but has a distinct identity rooted in Scottish culinary tradition. Its appearance is typically white and moist, with a consistency that can range from creamy to slightly grainy, depending on the production method. Crowdie is celebrated for its versatility and is a staple in Scottish households, often enjoyed as a breakfast item or snack.",
  "history": "Crowdie has a long history in Scotland, dating back to the Viking era, making it one of the oldest types of cheese in the region. It was traditionally made by crofters (small-scale farmers) using leftover milk after skimming off the cream for butter. This cheese was a practical way to preserve milk in a time before refrigeration. Over the centuries, Crowdie has remained a symbol of Scottish resilience and resourcefulness, embodying the simplicity and ingenuity of rural life. Today, it is still made using traditional methods, though it is less common than in the past.",
  "productionProcess": "Crowdie is made from cow's milk, which is gently heated and then curdled using a natural acid, such as lemon juice or vinegar, rather than rennet. The curds are drained in a cloth to remove excess whey, resulting in a soft, crumbly cheese. Unlike aged cheeses, Crowdie is consumed fresh, usually within a few days of production. Some modern variations may include added cream for a richer texture, but the traditional version remains simple and unadorned.",
  "flavorProfile": "Crowdie has a mild, fresh, and slightly tangy flavor with a clean, lactic finish. Its texture is soft and crumbly, with a moist, creamy mouthfeel. The aroma is fresh and milky, with no strong or pungent notes, making it approachable for a wide range of palates.",
  "pairings": "Crowdie pairs beautifully with traditional Scottish oatcakes or crusty bread, enhancing its rustic charm. For a sweet contrast, try it with honey, fresh berries, or a drizzle of heather-infused syrup. It also complements smoked salmon or cured meats, making it a versatile addition to charcuterie boards. Beverage pairings include light, crisp white wines like Sauvignon Blanc or a refreshing Scottish ale. For a non-alcoholic option, try it with a glass of buttermilk or a herbal tea.",
