  "description": "Sartori Reserve Basil Olive Oil Asiago is a unique, artisan hard cheese originating from the United States. Crafted from cow's milk, this cheese is distinguished by its infusion with basil and olive oil, offering a delightful twist on the traditional Asiago flavor. The cheese boasts a firm texture and a golden, slightly oily rind that hints at its rich, herbaceous infusion. Its interior is pale yellow, with a dense and crumbly consistency that makes it perfect for grating or slicing. The infusion of basil and olive oil not only adds a layer of complexity to its flavor but also enhances its aromatic profile, making it a standout choice for cheese enthusiasts seeking something beyond the ordinary.",
  "history": "Asiago cheese has its roots in the Asiago plateau in Italy, where it has been produced for centuries. The Sartori family, based in Wisconsin, USA, has been crafting artisanal cheeses since 1939, blending traditional European techniques with innovative flavors. The Reserve Basil Olive Oil Asiago is a testament to their creativity, combining the classic Asiago cheese-making process with the infusion of basil and olive oil. This cheese reflects the Sartori family's commitment to quality and innovation, offering a modern twist on a traditional favorite while maintaining the artisanal integrity of the original Asiago.",
  "productionProcess": "The production of Sartori Reserve Basil Olive Oil Asiago begins with high-quality cow's milk, which is curdled using traditional methods. The curds are then pressed and aged for several months to develop the cheese's characteristic texture and flavor. During the aging process, the cheese is infused with basil and olive oil, which permeates the cheese, adding depth and complexity to its flavor profile. This infusion process is carefully monitored to ensure that the cheese achieves the perfect balance of traditional Asiago flavors with the aromatic and savory notes of basil and olive oil.",
  "flavorProfile": "Sartori Reserve Basil Olive Oil Asiago offers a rich and complex flavor profile. The initial taste is nutty and slightly sweet, characteristic of traditional Asiago, followed by the savory and herbaceous notes of basil and the smooth, fruity undertones of olive oil. The cheese has a firm, crumbly texture that melts beautifully, releasing its aromatic flavors. The finish is long and satisfying, with a pleasant balance of savory and herbal notes that linger on the palate.",
  "pairings": "This cheese pairs wonderfully with a variety of foods and beverages. For a traditional pairing, enjoy it with crusty bread, olives, and cured meats. The herbaceous and savory notes of the cheese complement the richness of red wines, such as Chianti or Merlot, and the crispness of white wines like Pinot Grigio. For beer enthusiasts, a hoppy IPA or a malty amber ale can balance the cheese's richness. Innovative pairings include incorporating it into a Mediterranean-inspired salad or using it to elevate a simple pasta dish with its bold flavors.",
