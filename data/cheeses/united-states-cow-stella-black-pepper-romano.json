  "history": "Stella Black Pepper Romano is a modern interpretation of traditional Romano cheeses, which have their roots in Italy. While Romano cheese traditionally hails from the region around Rome, Stella's version brings an American twist by incorporating black pepper, a nod to the innovative spirit of artisan cheesemaking in the United States. This cheese reflects the growing trend of infusing classic cheese varieties with bold flavors to cater to contemporary palates. Its creation is a testament to the creativity and craftsmanship of American cheesemakers, who are redefining traditional cheese categories with unique ingredients and techniques.",
  "productionProcess": "Stella Black Pepper Romano is produced using high-quality cow's milk, which is curdled using traditional methods. The curds are then pressed and aged to develop the cheese's firm texture and concentrated flavor. A distinctive feature of its production is the addition of coarsely ground black pepper during the cheesemaking process, ensuring an even distribution of spice throughout the cheese. The aging process, which can vary in length, further intensifies the cheese's flavor, making it a robust choice for those who appreciate a bold taste.",
  "flavorProfile": "Stella Black Pepper Romano offers a complex flavor profile that combines the sharp, salty notes characteristic of Romano cheeses with the warm, spicy undertones of black pepper. Its aroma is pungent and inviting, with a hint of earthiness. The texture is hard and granular, making it perfect for grating, yet it also possesses a slight creaminess that adds depth to its mouthfeel. The interplay of flavors and textures makes this cheese a memorable experience for the palate.",
  "pairings": "Stella Black Pepper Romano pairs wonderfully with a variety of foods and beverages. Its bold flavor complements hearty red wines such as Cabernet Sauvignon or Zinfandel, while its spicy notes can be balanced with the sweetness of a Riesling. For beer enthusiasts, a robust IPA or a dark stout can stand up to the cheese's intensity. On the food front, it enhances pasta dishes, risottos, and salads. For a cheese board, pair it with cured meats, olives, and crusty bread to create a delightful contrast of flavors and textures.",
