  "description": "Milleens is a celebrated Irish artisan cheese, renowned for its soft texture and complex flavor profile. Originating from the Beara Peninsula in County Cork, Ireland, this cheese is a testament to the art of traditional cheesemaking. Milleens is made from cow's milk and is characterized by its creamy, almost runny interior and a natural, edible rind that develops a distinctive orange hue due to the growth of Brevibacterium linens. The cheese's appearance is rustic, with a slightly irregular shape that reflects its handmade nature. Milleens is celebrated for its ability to capture the essence of its terroir, offering a unique taste of the Irish landscape.",
  "history": "Milleens cheese was first created in the late 1970s by Veronica Steele, who is often credited with sparking the revival of farmhouse cheesemaking in Ireland. Steele, inspired by French cheese-making traditions, sought to create a cheese that reflected the unique qualities of her local environment. Milleens quickly gained acclaim for its distinctive flavor and artisanal quality, becoming a symbol of Ireland's burgeoning artisan food movement. Today, it is produced by Veronica's son, Quinlan Steele, who continues the family tradition, ensuring that Milleens remains a beloved and iconic Irish cheese.",
  "productionProcess": "Milleens cheese is made from the milk of Friesian cows that graze on the lush pastures of the Beara Peninsula. The milk is gently pasteurized before being inoculated with a starter culture and rennet to initiate curdling. The curds are then hand-ladled into molds, a process that contributes to the cheese's unique texture. After molding, the cheese is aged for several weeks in a humid environment, during which it is regularly turned and washed with a brine solution. This encourages the growth of the characteristic orange rind and develops the cheese's complex flavors.",
  "flavorProfile": "Milleens offers a rich and buttery flavor with a tangy, slightly nutty undertone. The aroma is earthy and pungent, indicative of its washed rind. The texture is luxuriously creamy, becoming almost liquid at room temperature, which makes it a delight to spread. The rind adds a subtle sharpness, balancing the cheese's overall richness.",
  "pairings": "Milleens pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include crusty bread, fresh fruits like apples and pears, and nuts, which complement its creamy texture and rich flavor. For drinks, a glass of full-bodied red wine, such as a Pinot Noir or a Syrah, enhances the cheese's complexity. Beer enthusiasts might enjoy it with a Belgian Dubbel or a stout, which can stand up to its bold flavors. For a non-alcoholic option, a dark, malty ale or a sparkling cider can also be delightful.",
