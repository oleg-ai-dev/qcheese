  "productionProcess": "The production of Alex James Co No 4 Goats cheese begins with the careful selection of high-quality goat's milk, which is then gently pasteurized to ensure safety while preserving the milk's natural flavors. The milk is curdled using a specific blend of cultures and rennet, after which the curds are delicately handled to maintain their soft texture. The cheese is then molded and allowed to drain, a process that helps achieve its characteristic freshness and lightness. Unlike aged cheeses, this variety is meant to be enjoyed soon after production, highlighting the fresh, tangy qualities of the goat's milk.",
