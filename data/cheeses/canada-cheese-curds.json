  "description": "Cheese Curds are a fresh, firm cheese product known for their distinctive squeaky texture when bitten into, a characteristic that is most pronounced when the curds are very fresh. Originating from regions in Canada, India, and the United States, these curds are a byproduct of the cheese-making process, specifically the cheddaring process. They are typically made from cow's milk, though variations can include milk from other animals. Cheese Curds are small, irregularly shaped pieces of curdled milk, with a moist, slightly rubbery texture and a mild, milky flavor. Their appearance is usually white or yellow, depending on whether they are made from uncolored or colored milk.",
  "history": "Cheese Curds have a rich history, particularly in Canada where they are a key ingredient in the national dish, poutine. Their origins can be traced back to the cheese-making traditions of the early settlers in North America, who discovered that the curds produced during the cheddaring process could be eaten fresh. In India, a similar concept exists with paneer, though paneer is made using a different process. Cheese Curds have become a cultural icon in regions where they are popular, symbolizing the simplicity and freshness of farm-to-table eating.",
  "productionProcess": "Cheese Curds are produced by adding a starter culture and rennet to warm milk, causing it to curdle. The curds are then cut into small pieces and heated to separate the curds from the whey. After draining, the curds are salted and sometimes pressed to remove additional whey, resulting in their characteristic firm texture. Unlike aged cheeses, Cheese Curds are consumed fresh, typically within a few days of production, to maintain their unique squeaky texture.",
  "flavorProfile": "Cheese Curds have a mild, fresh, and slightly tangy flavor with a milky undertone. Their most notable characteristic is the squeaky sound they make when bitten into, a result of their fresh, moist texture. The aroma is subtle and fresh, with a clean, dairy scent.",
  "pairings": "Cheese Curds are incredibly versatile in pairings. Traditionally, they are served as a snack or used in dishes like poutine, where they are topped with gravy and fries. They pair well with light beers, particularly lagers and pilsners, which complement their mild flavor. For wine, a crisp white wine like Sauvignon Blanc or a light-bodied red like Pinot Noir can be a good match. Accompaniments can include fresh fruits, nuts, and crusty bread for a simple, satisfying snack.",
