  "description": "Binnorie Marinated Fetta is a luxurious Australian cheese, crafted from cow's milk, known for its soft, brined texture and rich, tangy flavor. This cheese is distinguished by its marination process, where it is soaked in a blend of high-quality olive oil, herbs, and spices, enhancing its flavor profile and extending its shelf life. The cheese presents a creamy white appearance, with the marination adding a glossy sheen and speckles of herbs. Its texture is smooth and slightly crumbly, making it versatile for various culinary applications. Binnorie Marinated Fetta is a testament to the art of cheese-making, blending traditional techniques with innovative flavors.",
  "history": "Originating from the Hunter Valley in New South Wales, Australia, Binnorie Dairy has been at the forefront of artisanal cheese production since its inception. The Marinated Fetta is one of their signature products, reflecting the dairy's commitment to quality and innovation. This cheese is a modern interpretation of traditional feta, incorporating local Australian ingredients and flavors into the marination process. It represents a fusion of Mediterranean cheese-making traditions with Australian culinary creativity, making it a unique product in the global cheese market.",
  "productionProcess": "Binnorie Marinated Fetta begins with high-quality cow's milk, which is pasteurized and then curdled using a combination of rennet and lactic acid bacteria. The curds are cut, drained, and pressed into molds, after which the cheese is brined to develop its characteristic tangy flavor and soft texture. Following the brining process, the cheese is marinated in a mixture of olive oil, garlic, and a selection of herbs and spices, which infuse it with additional flavors and aromas. This marination not only enhances the cheese's taste but also acts as a natural preservative.",
  "flavorProfile": "Binnorie Marinated Fetta boasts a complex flavor profile, with a tangy and slightly salty base complemented by the aromatic infusion of herbs and spices from the marination. The olive oil adds a smooth, rich undertone, while the cheese itself has a creamy, slightly crumbly texture that melts in the mouth. The overall taste is balanced, with a harmonious blend of savory, tangy, and herbal notes.",
  "pairings": "This cheese pairs beautifully with crisp white wines, such as Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio, which complement its tangy flavor. For beer enthusiasts, a light lager or pilsner can balance the cheese's richness. Binnorie Marinated Fetta is also excellent with fresh, crusty bread, olives, and sun-dried tomatoes, making it a perfect addition to antipasto platters. For a more innovative pairing, try it with honey-drizzled figs or a spicy fruit chutney to contrast its tanginess.",
