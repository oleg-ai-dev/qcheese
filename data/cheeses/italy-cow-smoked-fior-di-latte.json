  "description": "Smoked Fior Di Latte is a semi-soft cheese originating from Italy, made from cow's milk. This cheese is known for its delicate, milky flavor and smooth, elastic texture, which is enhanced by a traditional smoking process. The smoking imparts a subtle, woody aroma and a golden-brown rind, adding depth to its otherwise mild profile. Its appearance is characterized by a pale, creamy interior that contrasts beautifully with its smoked exterior. Smoked Fior Di Latte is a versatile cheese, often used in both traditional Italian dishes and modern culinary creations.",
  "history": "Fior Di Latte, which translates to 'flower of milk,' has its roots in the rich dairy traditions of Italy. Originally a fresh cheese, it evolved to include smoked varieties as cheesemakers sought to preserve and enhance its flavor. The smoking process, traditionally done over natural wood, was a method to extend the cheese's shelf life while adding a unique taste. Over time, Smoked Fior Di Latte became a beloved ingredient in Italian cuisine, celebrated for its ability to add a smoky nuance to dishes without overpowering other flavors.",
  "productionProcess": "Smoked Fior Di Latte is made from pasteurized cow's milk, which is curdled using natural whey or rennet. The curds are then gently heated and stretched, a process known as pasta filata, which gives the cheese its characteristic elasticity. After shaping, the cheese is brined to enhance flavor and preserve it. The smoking process involves exposing the cheese to smoke from natural wood, such as beech or applewood, for several hours. This not only imparts a smoky flavor but also creates a protective rind. The cheese is then aged for a short period to allow the flavors to meld.",
  "flavorProfile": "Smoked Fior Di Latte offers a delicate balance of flavors. The initial taste is mild and milky, with a creamy, smooth texture that melts in the mouth. The smoking process adds a subtle, smoky aroma and a slightly tangy finish. The overall flavor is not overpowering, making it a versatile cheese that complements a wide range of dishes.",
  "pairings": "Smoked Fior Di Latte pairs wonderfully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include crusty bread, olives, and cured meats, which highlight its smoky notes. For a more innovative approach, try it with grilled vegetables or in a smoked cheese and pear salad. Wine pairings include light reds like Pinot Noir or crisp whites such as Sauvignon Blanc. Beer enthusiasts might enjoy it with a smoky porter or a light lager. For a non-alcoholic option, consider pairing it with apple cider or a sparkling water with a twist of lemon.",
