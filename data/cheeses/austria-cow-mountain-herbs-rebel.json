  "productionProcess": "Mountain Herbs Rebel is produced using high-quality cow's milk, which is carefully curdled using traditional methods. The curds are then pressed and infused with a selection of mountain herbs, which may include thyme, rosemary, and oregano, among others. The cheese is aged for several months, during which it develops its semi-hard texture and complex flavor profile. The aging process is crucial, as it allows the herbal flavors to meld seamlessly with the cheese, creating a harmonious and distinctive taste.",
  "flavorProfile": "Mountain Herbs Rebel offers a rich and aromatic flavor profile, with the mountain herbs providing a fresh, slightly floral, and earthy taste. The cheese has a creamy texture that balances its firmness, making it both satisfying and versatile. The herbal notes are prominent but not overpowering, allowing the natural flavors of the cow's milk to shine through. The finish is smooth, with a lingering herbal aftertaste that invites another bite.",
  "pairings": "Mountain Herbs Rebel pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include crusty bread, fresh fruits like apples and pears, and nuts, which complement its herbal flavors. For drinks, a crisp white wine such as Grüner Veltliner or a light beer can enhance the cheese's complexity. Innovative pairings might include incorporating it into herbaceous cocktails or serving it with honey for a sweet contrast. The cheese also works well in cooked dishes, adding depth to sauces and gratins.",
