  "description": "Stilton cheese, often referred to as the 'King of Cheeses', is a distinguished English blue cheese made from cow's milk. It boasts a rich, crumbly texture and a distinctive blue veining that runs throughout its ivory-colored body. Stilton is protected by a PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) status, meaning it can only be produced in the counties of Derbyshire, Leicestershire, and Nottinghamshire. Its unique flavor and appearance are the result of a meticulous aging process and the introduction of Penicillium roqueforti, the same mold used in Roquefort cheese. Stilton is celebrated for its bold, complex flavors and is a staple on cheese boards and in culinary dishes across the globe.",
  "history": "Stilton cheese's history dates back to the early 18th century, with its name derived from the village of Stilton in Cambridgeshire, which was a hub for its distribution. However, it was never actually produced in the village. The cheese gained prominence through its association with the Bell Inn in Stilton, where travelers would stop and enjoy the cheese. Over time, Stilton became synonymous with high-quality English cheese. Its production methods and characteristics were refined over the centuries, leading to the PDO status it holds today, ensuring its authenticity and quality.",
  "productionProcess": "Stilton cheese is made from pasteurized cow's milk, which is curdled using rennet. The curds are then cut, drained, and pressed into cylindrical molds. After unmolding, the cheese is pierced with stainless steel needles to allow air to enter, encouraging the growth of Penicillium roqueforti, which creates the characteristic blue veins. The cheese is aged for a minimum of nine weeks, during which it develops its complex flavors and crumbly texture. The entire process is closely monitored to ensure the cheese meets the strict standards required for its PDO status.",
  "flavorProfile": "Stilton cheese offers a rich and complex flavor profile, with a balance of sharpness and creaminess. It has a tangy, slightly spicy taste with earthy undertones, complemented by the distinctive tang of the blue mold. The aroma is pungent and inviting, with a buttery and crumbly texture that melts in the mouth.",
  "pairings": "Stilton pairs wonderfully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include port wine, which complements its rich flavors, and crackers or crusty bread. For a modern twist, try it with honey or fruit preserves to balance its sharpness. Stilton also works well in salads, adding a bold flavor to greens and nuts. Beer enthusiasts might enjoy it with a stout or barley wine, which can stand up to its robust profile.",
