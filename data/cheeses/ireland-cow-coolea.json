  "description": "Coolea cheese is a semi-hard to hard cheese originating from the Coolea area in County Cork, Ireland. It is made from cow's milk and is known for its smooth, firm texture and pale yellow color. The cheese is often compared to Gouda due to its sweet, nutty flavor profile, which becomes more pronounced with age. Coolea cheese is typically aged for several months to over a year, allowing it to develop a complex flavor that is both rich and mellow. Its rind is natural, sometimes coated with wax to preserve moisture and enhance aging. Coolea is a versatile cheese that can be enjoyed on its own, as part of a cheese board, or used in cooking.",
  "history": "Coolea cheese has its roots in the late 20th century, when the Willems family, originally from the Netherlands, settled in the Coolea area of Ireland. Drawing on their Dutch cheesemaking heritage, they began producing Coolea cheese, which quickly gained popularity for its quality and distinctive flavor. The cheese represents a unique blend of Irish and Dutch cheesemaking traditions, showcasing the rich agricultural heritage of the Coolea region. Over the years, Coolea cheese has become a celebrated product of Irish artisanal cheesemaking, appreciated by cheese lovers both in Ireland and internationally.",
  "productionProcess": "Coolea cheese is made from pasteurized cow's milk, which is curdled using traditional rennet. The curds are then pressed into molds and brined to develop flavor and texture. After brining, the cheese is aged in controlled conditions for a minimum of three months, though some varieties are aged for over a year to achieve a deeper flavor. During aging, the cheese is regularly turned and brushed to ensure even maturation. The use of wax coating on some varieties helps to retain moisture and protect the cheese during the aging process.",
  "flavorProfile": "Coolea cheese offers a sweet, nutty flavor with a smooth, firm texture that becomes more crumbly as it ages. Younger cheeses tend to be milder and creamier, while aged Coolea develops a more intense, complex flavor with hints of caramel and butterscotch. The aroma is rich and inviting, with a slight tanginess that complements its overall sweetness.",
  "pairings": "Coolea cheese pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include crusty bread, fresh fruits like apples and pears, and nuts such as walnuts and almonds. For drinks, it complements both red and white wines, particularly those with a fruity or nutty profile, such as Chardonnay or Merlot. Beer enthusiasts might enjoy it with a malty ale or a crisp lager. Coolea also works well in cooking, adding depth to dishes like quiches, gratins, and cheese sauces.",
