  "description": "Little Dragon is a distinctive soft cheese made from goat's milk, originating from the United States. This cheese is known for its creamy texture and delicate, bloomy rind that encases a soft, spreadable interior. Its appearance is characterized by a white, edible rind that develops as the cheese ages, offering a slight contrast to the pale, buttery interior. Little Dragon is celebrated for its unique balance of tangy and earthy flavors, making it a favorite among cheese enthusiasts who appreciate artisanal and handcrafted cheeses. Its small size and distinctive flavor profile make it a standout addition to any cheese board.",
  "history": "Little Dragon cheese is a relatively new addition to the American artisanal cheese scene, crafted by skilled cheesemakers who are passionate about creating unique and flavorful cheeses. While it doesn't have a long historical background, it represents the innovative spirit of modern American cheesemaking, drawing inspiration from traditional European soft cheeses. Its creation is a testament to the growing appreciation for high-quality, locally produced cheeses in the United States, showcasing the versatility and richness of goat's milk.",
  "productionProcess": "Little Dragon is made from high-quality goat's milk, which is carefully selected to ensure a rich and creamy base. The milk is gently pasteurized before being inoculated with specific cultures to develop its characteristic flavor. Rennet is added to coagulate the milk, forming curds that are then ladled into molds to drain. The cheese is aged for a short period, during which the bloomy rind develops. This aging process allows the flavors to mature, resulting in a cheese that is both complex and approachable.",
  "flavorProfile": "Little Dragon offers a delightful balance of tangy and earthy flavors, with a creamy, smooth texture that melts in the mouth. The bloomy rind adds a subtle mushroomy note, enhancing the overall complexity of the cheese. Its aroma is fresh and slightly goaty, with hints of grass and herbs, reflecting the quality of the goat's milk used in its production.",
  "pairings": "Little Dragon pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. For a traditional pairing, enjoy it with crusty bread, fresh fruits like apples or pears, and a drizzle of honey. It also complements nuts, such as walnuts or almonds, and can be served alongside charcuterie. In terms of beverages, a crisp white wine like Sauvignon Blanc or a light, fruity beer enhances its flavors. For a non-alcoholic option, try pairing it with a sparkling cider or herbal tea.",
