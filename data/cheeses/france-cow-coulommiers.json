  "description": "Coulommiers is a soft, artisan cheese made from cow's milk, originating from the Île-de-France region in France. It is often considered a precursor to Brie, sharing many of its characteristics but with a slightly smaller size and a more pronounced flavor. The cheese has a bloomy rind that is edible and a creamy, smooth interior that becomes runnier as it ages. Its appearance is marked by a white, velvety rind and a pale yellow interior. Coulommiers is known for its rich, buttery texture and a flavor that ranges from mild and milky when young to more complex and earthy as it matures.",
  "history": "Coulommiers cheese has its roots in the town of Coulommiers in the Île-de-France region, dating back to the Middle Ages. It was traditionally made by local farmers and monks, who refined the art of soft cheese making. Over time, Coulommiers gained recognition for its quality and became a staple in French cheesemaking traditions. Although it is less known internationally compared to Brie, it holds a special place in French culinary culture, often celebrated for its artisanal craftsmanship and deep-rooted history.",
  "productionProcess": "Coulommiers is made from pasteurized cow's milk, which is curdled using rennet. The curds are then gently ladled into molds, allowing the whey to drain naturally. This process helps retain the cheese's moisture and creamy texture. After molding, the cheese is salted and inoculated with Penicillium candidum, which develops the characteristic bloomy rind. The aging process lasts for about 4 to 6 weeks, during which the cheese develops its flavor and texture. The careful handling and traditional methods used in its production contribute to its artisanal quality.",
  "flavorProfile": "Coulommiers offers a rich, buttery flavor with a creamy, smooth texture. When young, it has a mild, milky taste with subtle hints of mushrooms and fresh cream. As it ages, the flavor becomes more pronounced, with earthy and nutty undertones. The rind adds a slight tanginess, balancing the richness of the interior. Its aroma is fresh and inviting, with a hint of earthiness that becomes more complex over time.",
  "pairings": "Coulommiers pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include crusty French bread, fresh fruits like apples and pears, and nuts such as walnuts. For drinks, it complements light-bodied red wines like Pinot Noir, crisp white wines such as Chardonnay, and sparkling wines like Champagne. Beer enthusiasts might enjoy it with a Belgian-style ale or a light lager. For a more innovative approach, try it with honey or fig jam to enhance its creamy texture and rich flavor.",
