  "description": "Stella Asiago is a semi-hard, artisan cheese originating from Italy, made exclusively from cow's milk. It boasts a smooth, slightly elastic texture and a pale yellow interior, encased in a natural rind that may vary in color from light yellow to a deeper golden hue. This cheese is celebrated for its versatility and depth of flavor, which can range from mild and buttery when young to more pronounced and nutty as it ages. Stella Asiago is a testament to the rich cheesemaking traditions of the Asiago plateau, offering a unique taste experience that reflects the terroir of its origin.",
  "history": "Asiago cheese has its roots in the Asiago plateau in the Veneto region of Italy, where it has been produced for centuries. Originally made from sheep's milk, the transition to cow's milk occurred in the 19th century, leading to the development of the cheese we know today. Stella Asiago, as a variant, continues this tradition, embodying the artisanal skills and dedication of local cheesemakers. It plays a significant role in the cultural and culinary heritage of the region, being a staple in Italian cuisine and a symbol of the area's rich agricultural history.",
  "productionProcess": "Stella Asiago is crafted from whole cow's milk, which is gently heated and then curdled using natural rennet. The curds are cut, cooked, and pressed into molds, where they are salted and left to age. The aging process can vary from a few months to over a year, during which the cheese develops its characteristic texture and flavor. Artisanal techniques are employed throughout, ensuring each wheel of Stella Asiago meets the highest standards of quality and taste.",
  "flavorProfile": "Stella Asiago offers a complex flavor profile that evolves with age. Younger versions are mild, creamy, and slightly sweet, while aged varieties develop a sharper, more robust taste with nutty and fruity undertones. The aroma is pleasantly earthy, with hints of butter and hay, complementing its smooth, yet firm texture.",
  "pairings": "Stella Asiago pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include crusty bread, olives, and cured meats, enhancing its rich flavors. For wine enthusiasts, a glass of Pinot Grigio or Merlot complements its nutty notes, while beer lovers might enjoy it with a crisp lager or a malty amber ale. Innovative pairings could include drizzling honey over aged Stella Asiago or incorporating it into a savory apple and cheese tart.",
