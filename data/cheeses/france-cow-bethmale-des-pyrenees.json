  "description": "Bethmale des Pyrénées is a semi-hard cheese originating from the Ariège department in the French Pyrenees. This cheese is made exclusively from cow's milk, distinguishing it from its goat and sheep milk counterparts in the region. It boasts a natural, rustic rind that is often slightly orange or brown, a result of the aging process. The interior is a pale yellow, with a smooth, supple texture that becomes more pronounced as it ages. Bethmale des Pyrénées is celebrated for its balanced flavor profile, which includes nutty and fruity notes, making it a versatile cheese for various culinary applications.",
  "history": "Bethmale des Pyrénées has its roots deeply embedded in the pastoral traditions of the French Pyrenees. Named after the Bethmale valley, this cheese has been produced for centuries, originally by local farmers who sought to preserve milk during the summer months. It holds a special place in the region's culinary heritage, embodying the pastoral lifestyle and the rich biodiversity of the Pyrenees. Over time, Bethmale des Pyrénées has gained recognition beyond its local origins, becoming a cherished product among cheese connoisseurs for its unique flavor and artisanal quality.",
  "productionProcess": "The production of Bethmale des Pyrénées begins with the collection of high-quality cow's milk, which is then gently heated and curdled using natural rennet. The curds are cut, stirred, and pressed into molds, where they begin to take shape. After unmolding, the cheeses are salted and then aged for a minimum of two months in cellars with controlled humidity and temperature. This aging process allows the cheese to develop its characteristic rind and complex flavor profile. Artisans pay close attention to the turning and brushing of the cheeses to ensure even aging and the development of the rind.",
  "flavorProfile": "Bethmale des Pyrénées offers a delightful balance of flavors, with a pronounced nuttiness complemented by subtle fruity undertones. The aroma is earthy and inviting, with hints of the alpine pastures from which the milk originates. Its texture is smooth and slightly elastic, providing a satisfying mouthfeel that enhances its rich, complex flavors.",
  "pairings": "Bethmale des Pyrénées pairs wonderfully with a variety of foods and beverages. For a traditional pairing, enjoy it with a slice of crusty bread and a glass of red wine from the Southwest of France, such as a Madiran or Cahors. It also complements light beers and ciders, which can accentuate its fruity notes. For a more innovative approach, try it with fig jam or honey, which will highlight its nutty flavors. Bethmale des Pyrénées is also a great addition to a cheese board, alongside dried fruits and nuts.",
