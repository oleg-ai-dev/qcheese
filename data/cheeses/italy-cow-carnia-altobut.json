  "description": "Carnia Altobut is a hard, artisan cheese originating from the Carnia region in Italy, known for its rugged landscapes and rich dairy traditions. This cheese is made exclusively from cow's milk, which contributes to its dense texture and deep, complex flavors. Carnia Altobut is characterized by its firm, compact paste and a natural rind that often bears the marks of its aging process. The cheese's appearance is typically a pale yellow, with a slightly granular texture that becomes more pronounced with age. Its unique characteristics include a balance of nutty and savory notes, making it a standout among Italian hard cheeses.",
  "history": "Carnia Altobut cheese has its roots in the Carnia region of northeastern Italy, an area renowned for its alpine pastures and artisanal cheese-making traditions. The cheese is a product of the local dairy culture, which has been shaped by the region's geography and climate. Historically, Carnia Altobut was made by local farmers as a way to preserve milk during the summer months when cows grazed on the high-altitude pastures. Over time, it has become a symbol of the region's culinary heritage, embodying the flavors and techniques passed down through generations of cheese makers.",
  "productionProcess": "The production of Carnia Altobut begins with high-quality cow's milk, which is gently heated and then curdled using natural rennet. The curds are cut, cooked, and pressed into molds, where they are left to drain and form the cheese's characteristic shape. After unmolding, the cheese is salted and then aged for several months to several years in cool, humid cellars. This aging process allows the cheese to develop its firm texture and complex flavor profile. Artisan techniques, such as regular turning and brushing of the rind, are employed to ensure even aging and to enhance the cheese's natural flavors.",
  "flavorProfile": "Carnia Altobut offers a rich and nuanced flavor profile, with a harmonious blend of nutty, buttery, and slightly tangy notes. Its aroma is earthy and inviting, with hints of alpine herbs and a subtle sweetness. The texture is firm and slightly crumbly, providing a satisfying mouthfeel that complements its robust flavors. As the cheese ages, it becomes more intense and complex, with a pronounced savory depth that lingers on the palate.",
  "pairings": "Carnia Altobut pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include crusty bread, honey, and cured meats, which highlight the cheese's nutty and savory qualities. For a more innovative approach, try it with fruit preserves or dark chocolate to contrast its richness. In terms of drinks, Carnia Altobut complements full-bodied red wines, such as Barolo or Amarone, as well as craft beers with malty or hoppy profiles. For a non-alcoholic option, a robust black tea or a glass of dry cider can also enhance the cheese's flavors.",
