Named after an old military road that runs through the region, this cheese is a nod to the area's rich history and natural beauty.

  "productionProcess": "Bayley Hazen Blue is made from high-quality, raw cow's milk, which is gently pasteurized to preserve its natural flavors. The milk is then inoculated with Penicillium roqueforti, the mold responsible for the cheese's characteristic blue veins. After curdling, the cheese is aged for approximately 60 days in the Cellars at Jasper Hill, where it develops its complex flavors and textures. The aging process is carefully monitored to ensure the perfect balance of moisture, flavor, and texture, resulting in a cheese that is both bold and refined.",
  "flavorProfile": "Bayley Hazen Blue offers a rich and complex flavor profile, with notes of grass, nuts, and a subtle sweetness that balances its bold, tangy blue cheese character. The aroma is earthy and inviting, with hints of mushroom and fresh cream. The texture is smooth and creamy, with a slight crumble that adds to its sensory appeal. This cheese is a harmonious blend of flavors and textures, making it a favorite among cheese enthusiasts.",
  "pairings": "Bayley Hazen Blue pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. For a classic pairing, serve it with a robust red wine, such as a Cabernet Sauvignon or a Port, which complements its bold flavors. It also pairs well with craft beers, particularly stouts and ales. For a delightful contrast, accompany it with fresh fruits like pears or apples, and nuts such as walnuts or almonds. Honey and crusty bread are also excellent accompaniments, enhancing the cheese's natural sweetness and complexity.",
