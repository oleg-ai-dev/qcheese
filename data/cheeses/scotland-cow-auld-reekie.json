  "description": "Auld Reekie is a distinctive hard cheese hailing from Scotland, known for its unique character and depth of flavor. This cheese is crafted from cow's milk, offering a firm texture that is both crumbly and smooth, depending on its age. Its appearance is marked by a natural, rustic rind that encases a pale yellow interior, hinting at the rich, creamy flavors within. Auld Reekie stands out for its bold, smoky aroma and taste, a result of being smoked over whisky barrel chips, which imparts a complex, peaty flavor profile reminiscent of Scotland's famous whisky. This cheese is a testament to the art of traditional Scottish cheesemaking, combining local ingredients and age-old techniques to create a product that is deeply rooted in its cultural heritage.",
  "history": "Auld Reekie cheese is a relatively modern creation that pays homage to Scotland's rich culinary and distilling traditions. The name 'Auld Reekie' is a nickname for Edinburgh, Scotland's capital, known for its historic smokiness from coal fires. This cheese was developed to capture the essence of Scotland's smoky, peaty flavors, particularly those found in its world-renowned whiskies. By smoking the cheese over whisky barrel chips, cheesemakers have created a product that is uniquely Scottish, offering a taste of the country's landscape and traditions in every bite. Auld Reekie cheese is a celebration of Scotland's artisanal food culture, blending the craftsmanship of cheesemaking with the iconic flavors of its whisky.",
  "productionProcess": "Auld Reekie cheese begins with high-quality cow's milk, which is carefully selected to ensure a rich and creamy base. The milk is then curdled using traditional methods, and the curds are pressed to form the cheese's firm texture. After the initial aging process, which helps develop its flavor and texture, the cheese is smoked over chips from used whisky barrels. This smoking process is crucial, as it infuses the cheese with a distinctive smoky, peaty flavor that is characteristic of Auld Reekie. The cheese is then aged further, allowing the flavors to meld and intensify, resulting in a complex and deeply satisfying taste experience.",
  "flavorProfile": "Auld Reekie cheese offers a bold and smoky flavor profile, with a pronounced peaty aroma that is reminiscent of Scotland's famous whiskies. The initial taste is rich and creamy, with a smooth texture that gradually gives way to a smoky, slightly tangy finish. The whisky barrel smoking process imparts a unique depth of flavor, with hints of oak and a subtle sweetness that balances the smokiness. This cheese is a sensory journey, evoking the rugged landscapes and traditional flavors of Scotland.",
  "pairings": "Auld Reekie cheese pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include oatcakes and hearty breads, which complement its smoky flavor. For a truly Scottish experience, pair it with a glass of peaty single malt whisky, allowing the flavors of the cheese and whisky to enhance each other. It also works well with dark beers and ales, which can stand up to its bold taste. For a lighter option, try it with crisp apples or pears, which provide a sweet contrast to the cheese's smokiness. Auld Reekie can also be used in cooking, adding depth to dishes like smoked cheese sauces or as a flavorful topping for baked potatoes.",
