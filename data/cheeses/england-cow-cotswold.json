  "description": "Cotswold cheese, also known as Double Gloucester with Chives and Onions, is a delightful semi-firm cheese originating from the Cotswold region in England. This cheese is a variant of the traditional Double Gloucester, distinguished by the addition of chives and onions, which impart a unique flavor and a speckled green appearance. Cotswold cheese boasts a creamy texture and a rich, buttery flavor, complemented by the subtle sharpness of the onions and the freshness of the chives. Its rind is typically natural and slightly waxy, encasing a smooth, pale yellow interior dotted with green flecks. This cheese is celebrated for its versatility and is a favorite among those who appreciate a flavorful yet approachable cheese.",
  "history": "Cotswold cheese has its roots in the pastoral landscapes of the Cotswolds, an area renowned for its dairy farming and cheesemaking traditions. The cheese is a modern creation, developed as a flavored version of the traditional Double Gloucester cheese. Double Gloucester itself has a long history, dating back to the 16th century, and was originally made from the milk of Gloucester cows. The addition of chives and onions to create Cotswold cheese is a relatively recent innovation, designed to offer a new twist on a classic. This cheese reflects the ingenuity of English cheesemakers in adapting traditional recipes to contemporary tastes.",
  "productionProcess": "Cotswold cheese is made from pasteurized cow's milk, which is curdled using traditional rennet. The curds are then cut, stirred, and gently heated to expel whey, resulting in a semi-firm texture. After the curds are pressed into molds, they are aged for a short period, typically a few weeks, to develop flavor. The distinctive feature of Cotswold cheese is the addition of finely chopped chives and onions to the curds before pressing. This step infuses the cheese with its characteristic flavor and appearance. The cheese is then aged in a controlled environment to allow the flavors to meld and mature.",
  "flavorProfile": "Cotswold cheese offers a harmonious blend of creamy, buttery richness with the fresh, slightly sharp flavors of chives and onions. The texture is smooth and semi-firm, making it easy to slice or spread. The aroma is mild with a hint of earthiness from the herbs. The overall taste is balanced, with the savory notes of the onions and the subtle herbaceousness of the chives complementing the natural sweetness of the milk.",
  "pairings": "Cotswold cheese pairs wonderfully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include crusty bread, crackers, and fresh fruits like apples and pears. It also complements savory items such as cured meats and pickles. For drinks, a crisp white wine like Sauvignon Blanc or a light ale enhances the cheese's flavors. Innovative pairings might include using Cotswold in a savory cheesecake or as a topping for baked potatoes. Its versatility makes it a great addition to cheese boards and a delightful ingredient in cooked dishes.",
