  "description": "Sao Jorge cheese, originating from the Azores island of Sao Jorge in Portugal, is a semi-hard cheese made exclusively from cow's milk. It boasts a firm yet slightly crumbly texture, with a natural rind that ranges from yellow to brown, depending on its age. The cheese is known for its distinctive, robust flavor that combines a slight tanginess with a nutty undertone, making it a favorite among cheese enthusiasts. Its unique characteristics are attributed to the lush pastures of Sao Jorge, where the cows graze, imparting a rich and complex flavor profile to the milk.",
  "history": "Sao Jorge cheese has a rich history dating back to the 15th century when Flemish settlers introduced cheesemaking to the Azores. Over the centuries, the cheese has become a symbol of the island's cultural heritage and a staple in Portuguese cuisine. The Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status, awarded in 1986, ensures that only cheese produced on Sao Jorge following traditional methods can bear the name, preserving its authenticity and quality. This cheese plays a significant role in the local economy and is celebrated in festivals and culinary events across Portugal.",
  "productionProcess": "Sao Jorge cheese is made from raw cow's milk, which is curdled using natural animal rennet. The curds are then cut, pressed into molds, and salted before being aged for a minimum of three months, though some varieties are aged for up to seven months or more to develop a more intense flavor. The aging process takes place in controlled environments, allowing the cheese to develop its characteristic texture and flavor. The traditional methods and the unique microclimate of Sao Jorge contribute to the cheese's distinctive qualities.",
  "flavorProfile": "Sao Jorge cheese offers a complex flavor profile that is both tangy and slightly spicy, with a nutty background and a hint of sweetness. Its aroma is rich and earthy, reflecting the lush pastures of its origin. The texture is firm yet crumbly, providing a satisfying mouthfeel that complements its bold flavors.",
  "pairings": "Sao Jorge cheese pairs wonderfully with full-bodied red wines, such as Douro or Alentejo, which complement its robust flavor. It also goes well with dark beers and port wine. For food pairings, it is excellent with crusty bread, quince paste, and cured meats. It can also be used in cooking, adding depth to dishes like soups, stews, and gratins.",
