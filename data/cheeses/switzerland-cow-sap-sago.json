  "description": "Sap Sago, also known as Schabziger, is a unique hard cheese originating from the Glarus region of Switzerland. It is distinguished by its vibrant green color, which comes from the addition of blue fenugreek (Trigonella caerulea) during production. This cheese is made from skimmed cow's milk, resulting in a low-fat content. Sap Sago has a firm, crumbly texture and is typically sold in small, cone-shaped blocks. Its flavor is sharp, tangy, and slightly spicy, with a distinctive herbal note from the fenugreek. Due to its intense flavor, it is often used sparingly, grated over dishes or incorporated into recipes for added depth.",
  "history": "Sap Sago has a rich history dating back to the 8th century in Switzerland. It was originally created by monks in the Glarus region as a way to preserve milk. The addition of blue fenugreek not only gave the cheese its characteristic color but also acted as a natural preservative. Over the centuries, Sap Sago became a staple in Swiss cuisine, particularly in the Glarus region. It gained popularity for its long shelf life and unique flavor, making it a valuable commodity for travelers and soldiers. Today, it remains a cherished part of Swiss culinary heritage, though it is less commonly found outside of Switzerland.",
  "productionProcess": "Sap Sago is made from skimmed cow's milk, which is first curdled using rennet. The curds are then pressed to remove excess whey and shaped into small cones. After shaping, the cheese is dried and aged for several months. The distinctive green color and flavor are achieved by mixing the curds with powdered blue fenugreek before pressing. This herb not only imparts color but also contributes to the cheese's unique spicy and herbal notes. The aging process further intensifies the flavor, resulting in a hard, crumbly cheese with a long shelf life.",
  "flavorProfile": "Sap Sago has a sharp, tangy flavor with a pronounced herbal and slightly spicy undertone from the blue fenugreek. Its aroma is pungent and earthy, reflecting its long aging process. The texture is firm and crumbly, making it ideal for grating. The cheese's intense flavor means it is often used in small quantities to add depth to dishes.",
  "pairings": "Sap Sago pairs well with hearty rye bread, which complements its robust flavor. It can also be grated over pasta, soups, or salads for added zest. Traditional Swiss pairings include serving it with potatoes or incorporating it into fondue for a unique twist. For beverages, a crisp white wine like Sauvignon Blanc or a light lager beer can balance the cheese's sharpness. Additionally, it pairs nicely with herbal teas or a dry cider.",
