  "description": "Little Qualicum Raclette is a semi-soft, artisan cheese originating from Canada, specifically crafted by the Little Qualicum Cheeseworks on Vancouver Island. This cheese is made from cow's milk, embodying the traditional characteristics of Raclette cheese with a Canadian twist. It boasts a smooth, creamy texture and a pale yellow interior, encased in a natural rind that adds to its rustic charm. The cheese is known for its excellent melting qualities, making it a favorite for culinary uses that require a gooey, rich texture. Its flavor is subtly nutty and slightly sweet, with a hint of earthiness that reflects the lush pastures of its origin.",
  "history": "Raclette cheese has its roots in the Swiss Alps, where it was traditionally melted and scraped onto plates as a hearty meal for mountain herders. Little Qualicum Cheeseworks brought this tradition to Canada, adapting the recipe to reflect the unique terroir of Vancouver Island. The cheese is a testament to the artisanal cheesemaking revival in Canada, showcasing the country's ability to produce world-class cheeses that honor traditional methods while embracing local flavors. Little Qualicum Raclette has gained recognition for its quality and has become a staple in Canadian cheese culture, representing the fusion of European tradition and Canadian innovation.",
  "productionProcess": "Little Qualicum Raclette is made from high-quality cow's milk, sourced from local farms on Vancouver Island. The milk is gently pasteurized before being inoculated with starter cultures and rennet to initiate curdling. The curds are then cut, stirred, and pressed into molds, where they begin to take shape. The cheese is aged for several months, during which it develops its characteristic flavor and texture. The aging process is carefully monitored to ensure the cheese achieves the perfect balance of moisture and firmness, making it ideal for melting.",
  "flavorProfile": "Little Qualicum Raclette offers a delightful balance of flavors, with a creamy, buttery texture that melts beautifully. Its taste is mildly nutty with a subtle sweetness, complemented by a slight earthiness that adds depth. The aroma is inviting, with hints of fresh milk and a touch of the natural rind's rustic character. This cheese is versatile, providing a rich and satisfying experience whether served melted or at room temperature.",
  "pairings": "Little Qualicum Raclette pairs wonderfully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include boiled potatoes, pickled onions, and cured meats, which complement its creamy texture and rich flavor. For a Canadian twist, try it with maple-glazed nuts or apple slices. Wine enthusiasts will appreciate its compatibility with light-bodied reds like Pinot Noir or crisp whites such as Riesling. Beer lovers can enjoy it with a malty amber ale or a smooth lager. For a non-alcoholic option, a sparkling apple cider makes a refreshing accompaniment.",
