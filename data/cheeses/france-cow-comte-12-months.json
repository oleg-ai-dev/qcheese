  "description": "Comté 12 Months is a celebrated semi-hard cheese from the Jura Massif region of France, renowned for its complex flavor and artisanal production methods. Made exclusively from the milk of Montbéliarde and French Simmental cows, this cheese boasts a firm, slightly crumbly texture and a natural, rustic rind that hints at its traditional aging process. Its interior is a pale yellow, with small, scattered eyes that add to its visual appeal. Comté 12 Months is distinguished by its balanced flavor profile, which develops depth and nuance over its year-long aging period. It is a staple in French cuisine and a favorite among cheese connoisseurs worldwide.",
  "history": "Comté cheese has a storied history that dates back to the Middle Ages, originating in the Franche-Comté region of France. It was developed as a way to preserve milk in a region where the cold winters made fresh milk storage challenging. Over centuries, Comté has become a symbol of French cheesemaking excellence, with its production strictly regulated by AOC (Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée) guidelines since 1958. These regulations ensure that every wheel of Comté is made following traditional methods, from the specific breeds of cows used for milk to the aging process in dedicated cellars. Comté 12 Months represents the younger end of the aging spectrum, offering a more accessible introduction to the cheese's complex flavors.",
  "productionProcess": "Comté 12 Months is produced using raw cow's milk from Montbéliarde and French Simmental cows, which graze on the rich, diverse pastures of the Jura Massif. The milk is gently heated and curdled using natural rennet, then pressed into large wheels. These wheels are salted and transferred to aging cellars, where they are turned and brushed regularly to develop their characteristic rind. The cheese ages for a minimum of 12 months, during which time it develops its semi-hard texture and complex flavor profile. The aging process is carefully monitored by affineurs, who ensure the cheese reaches its full potential.",
  "flavorProfile": "Comté 12 Months offers a harmonious blend of nutty, buttery, and slightly sweet flavors, with hints of fruit and a subtle earthiness that reflects its terroir. Its aroma is rich and inviting, with notes of toasted nuts and fresh cream. The texture is smooth and firm, yet it melts beautifully, making it versatile in both raw and cooked forms.",
  "pairings": "Comté 12 Months pairs wonderfully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include crusty bread, dried fruits, and nuts, which complement its nutty flavor. For wine, opt for a Chardonnay from Burgundy or a light red like Pinot Noir. Beer enthusiasts might enjoy it with a malty amber ale. Innovative pairings include dark chocolate or a drizzle of honey for a sweet contrast. It also shines in fondue or melted over roasted vegetables.",
