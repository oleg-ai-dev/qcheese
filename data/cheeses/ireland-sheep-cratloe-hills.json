The milk is gently heated and then curdled using traditional rennet, a process that respects the natural qualities of the milk. The curds are then pressed to remove excess whey, resulting in a firm texture. The cheese is aged for several months, during which it develops its characteristic flavor and rind. The aging process is crucial, as it allows the cheese to mature and acquire its depth of taste. Artisan techniques are employed throughout, ensuring that each wheel of Cratloe Hills cheese is a testament to the skill and dedication of its makers.",

The cheese's aroma is earthy and inviting, with hints of the Irish pastures from which it originates. Its texture is firm yet creamy, making it a delight to eat. As it ages, the flavors become more pronounced, offering a deeper and more satisfying taste experience.",
  "pairings": "Cratloe Hills cheese pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and drinks. It complements crisp white wines, such as Sauvignon Blanc, which balance its richness with acidity.
