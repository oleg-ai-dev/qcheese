  "history": "Stella Italian Sharp cheese is a testament to the rich tradition of Italian cheesemaking, adapted and perfected in the United States. While specific historical details about Stella Italian Sharp are scarce, it is part of a broader movement of artisanal cheesemaking in the U.S. that draws inspiration from European traditions. This cheese reflects the Italian influence on American cheesemaking, showcasing the ability to produce high-quality, flavorful cheeses that rival their European counterparts. Its creation is a nod to the Italian love for sharp, flavorful cheeses, adapted to the tastes and preferences of the American market.",
  "productionProcess": "Stella Italian Sharp is made from high-quality cow's milk, which is carefully selected to ensure the cheese's rich flavor and texture. The milk is pasteurized and then curdled using traditional methods, often involving the addition of rennet to achieve the desired consistency. After curdling, the curds are cut, drained, and pressed into molds. The cheese is then aged for a period that allows it to develop its characteristic sharpness and semi-soft texture. The aging process is crucial, as it enhances the cheese's flavor complexity and texture.",

The cheese's flavor deepens with age, becoming more complex and intense, making it a favorite among those who enjoy cheeses with a strong, distinctive taste.",
