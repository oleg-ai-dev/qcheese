The milk type, while unspecified, could be cow's, goat's, or sheep's milk, each contributing its own nuances to the cheese's flavor and texture. The aging process is crucial, as it helps to develop the cheese's complex flavors and soft, spreadable texture.",

The bloomy rind adds a slight earthy note, enhancing the cheese's overall complexity. Its texture is luxuriously soft, making it a delight to spread on bread or crackers.",
  "pairings": "This cheese pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. For a traditional pairing, try it with a crisp white wine or a light beer, which can complement its creamy texture and rich flavors. It also works well with fresh fruits like apples or pears, and nuts such as walnuts or almonds, adding a delightful contrast in textures and flavors. For a more innovative approach, incorporate Letoile De St Raymond into a gourmet grilled cheese sandwich or use it as a luxurious topping for a flatbread.",
