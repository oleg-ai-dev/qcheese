  "description": "Majorero cheese is a distinguished semi-hard cheese made exclusively from the milk of the Majorera goat, a breed native to the Canary Islands, specifically Fuerteventura. This cheese is celebrated for its rich, slightly tangy flavor and firm yet creamy texture. It typically presents a natural rind that may be rubbed with oil, paprika, or gofio (a local toasted cornmeal), giving it a unique appearance and additional flavor nuances. Majorero is often aged for a minimum of 60 days, which enhances its complexity and depth. Its versatility and distinctive taste make it a prized component of Spanish cheese boards and culinary creations.",
  "history": "Majorero cheese has its roots deeply embedded in the agricultural traditions of Fuerteventura, the second largest of the Canary Islands. The cheese is named after the Majorera goat, which has adapted to the island's arid climate and scarce vegetation. Historically, Majorero cheese was a staple for local families, providing a sustainable source of nutrition. Over time, its production has evolved from a household craft to a protected designation of origin (PDO) product, recognized for its quality and traditional methods. This recognition has helped preserve the cheese-making heritage of Fuerteventura and promote its unique flavors to a global audience.",
  "productionProcess": "The production of Majorero cheese begins with the collection of fresh, whole goat's milk from the Majorera breed. The milk is then gently heated and coagulated using animal rennet, forming curds that are cut, drained, and pressed into molds. The cheese is salted, either by dry salting or brine, and then aged for a minimum of 60 days. During aging, the cheese may be treated with oil, paprika, or gofio on its rind, contributing to its distinctive flavor and appearance. The entire process adheres to traditional methods, ensuring the cheese's authenticity and quality.",
  "flavorProfile": "Majorero cheese offers a complex flavor profile characterized by a balance of tanginess and richness, with subtle hints of nuts and herbs. Its aroma is fresh and inviting, with a slight earthiness from the rind treatments. The texture is semi-hard, providing a satisfying chewiness that melts smoothly on the palate. The aging process imparts a depth of flavor that is both robust and nuanced, making it a delightful experience for cheese enthusiasts.",
  "pairings": "Majorero cheese pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include crusty bread, quince paste, and olives, which complement its tangy and rich flavors. For wine enthusiasts, a glass of full-bodied red wine or a crisp white wine enhances the cheese's complexity. Beer lovers might enjoy it with a malty ale or a light lager. Innovative pairings could include Majorero in salads with arugula and walnuts, or melted over roasted vegetables for a flavorful twist.",
