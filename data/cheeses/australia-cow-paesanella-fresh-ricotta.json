  "description": "Paesanella Fresh Ricotta is a delightful, soft cheese originating from Australia, made from cow's milk. This cheese is celebrated for its creamy texture and mild, slightly sweet flavor, making it a versatile ingredient in both sweet and savory dishes. Its appearance is typically white and moist, with a fine, grainy texture that is characteristic of fresh ricotta. Unlike aged cheeses, Paesanella Fresh Ricotta is meant to be enjoyed soon after production, offering a fresh and light taste that can enhance a variety of culinary creations.",
  "history": "Ricotta cheese has its roots in Italy, where it was traditionally made from the whey leftover from the production of other cheeses. The name 'ricotta' means 'recooked' in Italian, referring to the process of reheating the whey to produce the cheese. While Paesanella Fresh Ricotta is an Australian product, it adheres to the traditional methods of ricotta production, showcasing the global appreciation and adaptation of Italian cheesemaking techniques. Its introduction to the Australian market has provided a local option for those seeking the fresh, creamy qualities of ricotta without the need for importation.",
  "productionProcess": "Paesanella Fresh Ricotta is made from cow's milk, which is first pasteurized to ensure safety. The milk is then acidified, typically with the addition of an acid like vinegar or lemon juice, to separate the curds from the whey. The curds are gently heated and then drained, resulting in the soft, moist cheese known as ricotta. Unlike some cheeses, ricotta does not undergo an aging process and is best consumed fresh, within a few days of production, to enjoy its delicate flavor and texture.",
  "flavorProfile": "Paesanella Fresh Ricotta boasts a mild, slightly sweet flavor with a creamy and moist texture. Its subtle taste makes it an excellent canvas for both savory and sweet dishes, allowing it to blend seamlessly with a variety of ingredients. The aroma is fresh and milky, inviting and comforting, which complements its soft, spreadable consistency.",
  "pairings": "This cheese pairs wonderfully with fresh fruits like berries and figs, enhancing its natural sweetness. For savory options, it complements herbs, roasted vegetables, and crusty bread beautifully. In terms of beverages, a light white wine or a crisp, refreshing beer can balance the creaminess of the ricotta. For a truly indulgent experience, drizzle it with honey and pair with a dessert wine.",
