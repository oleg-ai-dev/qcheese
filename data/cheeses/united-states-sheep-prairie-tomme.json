  "description": "Prairie Tomme is a semi-hard, artisan cheese made from sheep's milk, originating from the United States. This cheese is celebrated for its rustic charm and complex flavor profile, which is a testament to the artisanal cheesemaking process. Prairie Tomme typically features a natural rind that may develop a variety of molds, contributing to its unique appearance and depth of flavor. The interior of the cheese is firm yet yielding, with a texture that strikes a perfect balance between creamy and crumbly. Its color ranges from pale yellow to a deeper golden hue, depending on the aging process. Prairie Tomme is a versatile cheese that can be enjoyed on its own or used in a variety of culinary applications.",
  "history": "Prairie Tomme is a relatively recent addition to the American artisanal cheese scene, reflecting the growing interest in and appreciation for high-quality, locally produced cheeses. While specific historical details about Prairie Tomme are scarce, it is part of a broader movement in the United States towards reviving and innovating traditional cheesemaking techniques. This cheese embodies the spirit of American artisanal cheesemaking, which emphasizes quality, sustainability, and the expression of terroir. Prairie Tomme, with its sheep's milk base, also highlights the versatility and richness of sheep's milk in producing cheeses with complex flavors and textures.",
  "productionProcess": "Prairie Tomme is made from high-quality sheep's milk, which is known for its richness and high butterfat content. The milk is gently heated and then coagulated using traditional rennet or microbial enzymes. After the curds are formed, they are cut, stirred, and pressed to expel whey, resulting in a firm yet pliable texture. The cheese is then salted, either by brining or dry salting, to enhance flavor and aid in preservation. Aging takes place in carefully controlled environments, where the cheese develops its characteristic rind and complex flavors over several months. The aging process is crucial for developing the semi-hard texture and depth of flavor that Prairie Tomme is known for.",
  "flavorProfile": "Prairie Tomme offers a rich and nuanced flavor profile, with notes of butter, nuts, and a slight tanginess that is characteristic of sheep's milk cheeses. The aroma is earthy and inviting, with hints of grass and hay that reflect the pastoral origins of the milk. The texture is semi-hard, providing a satisfying chew without being overly dense. As the cheese ages, it develops deeper, more complex flavors, including subtle hints of mushroom and a pleasant, lingering finish.",
  "pairings": "Prairie Tomme pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. For a traditional pairing, enjoy it with crusty bread, fresh fruits like apples or pears, and a selection of nuts. It also complements charcuterie and pickled vegetables. In terms of beverages, Prairie Tomme goes well with medium-bodied red wines, such as Pinot Noir or Syrah, which can stand up to its rich flavor. For beer lovers, a Belgian-style ale or a crisp lager can be a delightful match. For a more innovative pairing, try it with a honey drizzle or a fig jam to enhance its natural sweetness.",
