  "description": "Meira cheese is a semi-hard cheese originating from Iraq, made exclusively from sheep's milk. This cheese is known for its firm yet slightly crumbly texture, which makes it versatile for various culinary uses. It typically has a pale yellow color and a natural rind that develops during the aging process. Meira cheese is celebrated for its rich, nutty flavor and a subtle tanginess that is characteristic of sheep's milk cheeses. Its unique taste profile and texture make it a cherished component in Middle Eastern cuisine, often used in both traditional and modern dishes.",
  "history": "Meira cheese has its roots deeply embedded in the pastoral traditions of Iraq, where sheep herding has been a way of life for centuries. The cheese is a product of the region's rich dairy heritage, reflecting the skills and knowledge passed down through generations of cheesemakers. While not widely documented in global cheese literature, Meira holds a significant place in local culinary traditions, often served during special occasions and family gatherings. Its production is a testament to the enduring legacy of artisanal cheesemaking in the Middle East, preserving a connection to the land and its history.",
  "productionProcess": "Meira cheese is crafted from high-quality sheep's milk, which is first pasteurized to ensure safety. The milk is then curdled using natural rennet, a traditional method that helps develop its distinctive texture and flavor. After curdling, the curds are cut, drained, and pressed into molds to form the cheese. The aging process for Meira cheese typically lasts several months, during which it develops its semi-hard texture and complex flavor profile. The cheese is regularly turned and salted to promote even aging and to enhance its taste.",
  "flavorProfile": "Meira cheese offers a rich and nutty flavor with a subtle tanginess that is characteristic of sheep's milk cheeses. Its aroma is earthy and inviting, with hints of grass and herbs that reflect the natural diet of the sheep. The texture is firm yet slightly crumbly, providing a satisfying mouthfeel that complements its robust flavor. This cheese is a delightful balance of savory and slightly sweet notes, making it a versatile choice for various culinary applications.",
  "pairings": "Meira cheese pairs wonderfully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include flatbreads, olives, and fresh vegetables, which highlight its rich flavor. For a more contemporary approach, try it with honey, dried fruits, or nuts to enhance its nutty and sweet notes. In terms of beverages, Meira cheese complements full-bodied red wines, such as Syrah or Cabernet Sauvignon, and robust beers like stouts or porters. It also pairs well with herbal teas, which can bring out its earthy undertones.",
