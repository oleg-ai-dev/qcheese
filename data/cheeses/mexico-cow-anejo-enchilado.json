  "description": "Añejo Enchilado is a distinctive Mexican cheese known for its bold flavor and unique preparation. Originating from Mexico, this semi-hard cheese is made from a blend of cow and goat milk, offering a rich and complex base. The cheese is easily recognizable by its deep red or orange coating, which comes from being rolled in a mixture of chili powder and paprika, giving it a spicy kick. Its texture is firm yet crumbly, making it versatile for various culinary uses. Añejo Enchilado is aged for several months, which intensifies its flavors and contributes to its slightly grainy texture. This cheese is a testament to Mexico's vibrant culinary traditions, embodying the country's love for bold, spicy flavors.",
  "history": "Añejo Enchilado has its roots deeply embedded in Mexican culinary traditions, where cheese making is an art form passed down through generations. The practice of coating cheese with chili powder and paprika is a nod to Mexico's rich history of spice cultivation and usage. This cheese is a celebration of the country's diverse flavors, combining the creamy richness of cow and goat milk with the fiery zest of Mexican spices. It serves not only as a staple in Mexican households but also as a cultural ambassador, introducing the world to the complexity and depth of Mexican cheese-making.",
  "productionProcess": "The production of Añejo Enchilado begins with the careful selection of cow and goat milk, which is then pasteurized and curdled using traditional methods. The curds are pressed to remove whey, resulting in a semi-hard cheese. After initial aging, the cheese is rolled in a mixture of chili powder and paprika, which not only adds flavor but also acts as a preservative. The cheese is then aged for several months, allowing the flavors to mature and the texture to become firm and crumbly. This process highlights the artisanal nature of Añejo Enchilado, showcasing the skill and patience required to produce such a distinctive cheese.",
  "flavorProfile": "Añejo Enchilado offers a complex flavor profile that is both spicy and tangy, with a creamy undertone from the blend of cow and goat milk. The chili and paprika coating provides a fiery kick that is balanced by the cheese's inherent richness. Its aroma is pungent and inviting, with hints of earthiness and spice. The texture is firm and crumbly, making it a delight to eat on its own or as part of a dish.",
  "pairings": "Añejo Enchilado pairs wonderfully with robust red wines, such as a Zinfandel or Malbec, which can stand up to its bold flavors. For beer lovers, a dark ale or stout complements the cheese's spiciness. Traditional accompaniments include fresh fruits like mango or pineapple, which provide a sweet contrast to the cheese's heat. It also works well in dishes that call for a flavorful cheese, such as tacos, enchiladas, or as a topping for soups and salads.",
