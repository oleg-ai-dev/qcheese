  "description": "Pecorino Romano is a hard, salty Italian cheese made from sheep's milk, primarily produced in the regions of Lazio, Sardinia, and Grosseto. It boasts a pale yellow color and a granular texture, which becomes more pronounced with age. The cheese is encased in a natural rind that is often treated with a black coating to protect it during the aging process. Pecorino Romano is renowned for its sharp, tangy flavor, which intensifies as it matures, making it a staple in Italian cuisine, especially for grating over pasta dishes.",
  "history": "Pecorino Romano has ancient origins, dating back over 2,000 years to the Roman Empire, where it was a dietary staple for Roman soldiers due to its long shelf life and high nutritional value. The name 'Pecorino' derives from 'pecora', the Italian word for sheep, highlighting its primary ingredient. Over centuries, it has maintained its status as a key component of Italian culinary tradition, embodying the pastoral heritage of the regions where it is produced. Its production is strictly regulated under the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status, ensuring its quality and authenticity.",
  "productionProcess": "Pecorino Romano is made exclusively from whole sheep's milk, which is heated and then curdled using lamb rennet. The curds are broken into small granules, cooked, and then pressed into molds to form the cheese wheels. After salting, the cheese is aged for a minimum of 5 months, though some varieties are aged for up to 8 months or longer to develop a more intense flavor. The aging process takes place in cool, ventilated rooms, allowing the cheese to develop its characteristic texture and taste.",
  "flavorProfile": "Pecorino Romano is known for its bold, tangy, and slightly salty flavor, with a rich, nutty undertone that becomes more pronounced with age. Its texture is firm and crumbly, making it ideal for grating. The aroma is sharp and earthy, reflecting its sheep's milk origin and traditional aging process.",
  "pairings": "Pecorino Romano pairs wonderfully with full-bodied red wines such as Chianti or Barolo, which complement its robust flavor. It also goes well with crisp white wines like Vermentino. For beer enthusiasts, a hoppy IPA can balance the cheese's saltiness. Traditional accompaniments include honey, pears, and walnuts, which contrast its sharpness. It's also a key ingredient in classic Italian dishes like Cacio e Pepe and Carbonara.",
