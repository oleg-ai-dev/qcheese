  "description": "St Tola Ash Log is a distinctive Irish artisan cheese made from goat's milk, celebrated for its soft texture and unique appearance. This cheese is easily recognizable by its ash-coated rind, which not only contributes to its striking visual appeal but also imparts a subtle, earthy flavor to the cheese. The interior of the St Tola Ash Log is creamy and smooth, with a pale ivory color that contrasts beautifully with the dark ash exterior. It is a testament to the artisanal cheesemaking traditions of Ireland, offering a delightful balance of flavors and textures that make it a favorite among cheese enthusiasts.",
  "history": "St Tola Ash Log originates from the lush pastures of County Clare, Ireland, where the St Tola Goat Cheese company has been crafting artisanal cheeses since the 1980s. The company was founded with the aim of reviving traditional Irish cheesemaking techniques, using locally sourced goat's milk. The Ash Log variant is a nod to the ancient practice of using ash to preserve and flavor cheese, a technique that has been embraced by modern cheesemakers for its aesthetic and culinary benefits. St Tola Ash Log has gained recognition for its quality and craftsmanship, embodying the rich cheesemaking heritage of Ireland.",
  "productionProcess": "St Tola Ash Log is made from pasteurized goat's milk, which is carefully selected for its quality and freshness. The milk is gently heated and then curdled using vegetarian rennet. After the curds have formed, they are hand-ladled into molds, a process that ensures the cheese retains its delicate texture. The young cheeses are then coated with a layer of vegetable ash, which helps to develop the rind and adds a distinctive flavor. The cheese is aged for a short period, allowing it to develop its characteristic creamy interior and complex flavors. The entire process is carried out with meticulous attention to detail, reflecting the artisanal nature of the cheese.",
  "flavorProfile": "St Tola Ash Log offers a complex flavor profile that is both tangy and creamy, with a subtle earthy undertone from the ash coating. The cheese has a rich, buttery texture that melts in the mouth, complemented by a slight acidity that is characteristic of goat's milk cheeses. The aroma is fresh and inviting, with hints of grass and herbs, reflecting the natural diet of the goats. Overall, St Tola Ash Log is a harmonious blend of flavors and textures that is both sophisticated and approachable.",
  "pairings": "St Tola Ash Log pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. For a traditional pairing, serve it with crusty bread and a drizzle of honey to complement its creamy texture and tangy flavor. It also pairs well with crisp white wines, such as Sauvignon Blanc or Chardonnay, which balance the cheese's acidity. For a more adventurous pairing, try it with a light, hoppy beer or a dry cider. The cheese's earthy notes also make it a great match for salads featuring nuts and fresh greens, or as a luxurious addition to a cheese board with dried fruits and nuts.",
