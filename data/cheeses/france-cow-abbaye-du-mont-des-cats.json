  "description": "Abbaye du Mont des Cats is a semi-soft, artisan cheese made from cow's milk, originating from the northern region of France, near the Belgian border. This cheese is produced by Trappist monks at the Mont des Cats Abbey, following a tradition that dates back to the 19th century. It has a smooth, supple texture and a distinctive orange rind, which is a result of the brining process it undergoes. The interior is pale yellow, with small, irregular holes scattered throughout. Abbaye du Mont des Cats is known for its rich, buttery flavor and a slightly tangy finish, making it a favorite among cheese enthusiasts.",
  "history": "The history of Abbaye du Mont des Cats cheese is deeply intertwined with the monastic traditions of the Mont des Cats Abbey. The abbey was founded in 1826, and the monks began producing cheese as a means of sustaining their community. The recipe and techniques were influenced by the neighboring Belgian cheesemaking traditions, particularly those of the Trappist monasteries. Over the years, the cheese has gained a reputation for its quality and unique flavor profile, becoming a symbol of the region's rich cheesemaking heritage.",
  "productionProcess": "Abbaye du Mont des Cats is made from pasteurized cow's milk. The milk is curdled using traditional rennet, and the curds are then cut, drained, and pressed into molds. The cheese is brined, which helps to develop its characteristic rind and flavor. After brining, it is aged for about two months in the abbey's cellars, where it develops its semi-soft texture and complex flavor profile. The aging process is carefully monitored to ensure the cheese reaches its optimal taste and texture.",
  "flavorProfile": "Abbaye du Mont des Cats offers a rich, buttery flavor with a creamy, smooth texture. It has a slightly tangy finish, complemented by a subtle nuttiness. The aroma is mild and inviting, with hints of earthiness from the aging process. The cheese's brined rind adds a slight saltiness, enhancing its overall flavor complexity.",
  "pairings": "Abbaye du Mont des Cats pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include crusty bread, fresh fruits like apples and pears, and nuts such as walnuts. For drinks, it complements well with Belgian Trappist ales, which share a monastic heritage, and light red wines like Pinot Noir. For a more innovative pairing, try it with honey or fig jam to balance its richness, or enjoy it with a crisp, dry cider for a refreshing contrast.",
