  "description": "Abbaye De Belval is a semi-hard cheese originating from the Picardy region in northern France. It is traditionally made by Trappist monks at the Belval Abbey, reflecting a deep monastic cheesemaking heritage. The cheese has a smooth, slightly elastic texture and a pale yellow interior with a natural, washed rind that develops a reddish hue as it ages. Its flavor is mild yet complex, with nutty and buttery notes, and a subtle tanginess that becomes more pronounced with age. Abbaye De Belval is often shaped into large wheels, making it a striking addition to any cheese board.",
  "history": "Abbaye De Belval traces its roots to the Trappist monks of Belval Abbey, who have been crafting cheese since the early 20th century. The abbey, founded in 1893, became a center for monastic cheesemaking, blending spiritual devotion with artisanal craftsmanship. The cheese was initially produced to sustain the monastic community but gained regional acclaim for its quality. Today, it remains a symbol of the abbey's dedication to tradition and simplicity, though production has expanded beyond the monastery to meet growing demand.",
  "productionProcess": "Abbaye De Belval is made from pasteurized cow's milk, which is gently heated and curdled using traditional rennet. The curds are cut, drained, and pressed into molds to form the characteristic wheel shape. The cheese is then washed with a brine solution to encourage the growth of beneficial bacteria on the rind, which contributes to its unique flavor and aroma. It is aged for a minimum of 2-3 months, during which it develops its semi-hard texture and complex flavor profile.",
  "flavorProfile": "Abbaye De Belval offers a delicate balance of flavors, with a creamy, nutty base and a hint of tanginess. Its aroma is earthy and slightly pungent, characteristic of washed-rind cheeses. The texture is smooth and slightly springy, making it a pleasure to slice or cube. As it ages, the cheese develops a more robust flavor, with deeper umami notes and a lingering finish.",
  "pairings": "Abbaye De Belval pairs beautifully with crusty bread, fresh fruit like apples or pears, and nuts such as walnuts or almonds. For beverages, try a light red wine like Pinot Noir or a crisp white wine such as Chardonnay. Beer enthusiasts will enjoy it with a Belgian-style ale or a malty lager. For a more adventurous pairing, serve it with honey or fig jam to complement its nutty sweetness.",
