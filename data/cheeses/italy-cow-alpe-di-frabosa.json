  "description": "Alpe Di Frabosa is a semi-soft cheese originating from the Piedmont region of Italy, specifically from the Frabosa Soprana and Frabosa Sottana areas. This cheese is made from cow's milk and is known for its creamy texture and delicate, slightly tangy flavor. The rind is typically thin and edible, with a natural, rustic appearance that hints at its artisanal production. Alpe Di Frabosa is often enjoyed young, when its flavors are mild and its texture is at its creamiest, but it can also be aged to develop a more pronounced taste and firmer texture. Its unique characteristics are a testament to the traditional cheesemaking techniques of the Italian Alps.",
  "history": "Alpe Di Frabosa cheese has its roots in the pastoral traditions of the Piedmontese Alps, where dairy farming has been a way of life for centuries. The cheese is named after the Frabosa valleys, areas renowned for their lush pastures and high-quality milk. Historically, this cheese was made by local farmers as a way to preserve milk during the summer months when cows grazed on the alpine meadows. Over time, Alpe Di Frabosa has become a symbol of the region's cheesemaking heritage, embodying the flavors and traditions of the Italian Alps.",
  "productionProcess": "The production of Alpe Di Frabosa begins with the collection of fresh cow's milk from local farms. The milk is then gently heated and curdled using natural rennet. After the curds are formed, they are cut, drained, and pressed into molds to shape the cheese. The cheese is then salted and left to age in cool, humid cellars for a period that can range from a few weeks to several months. During this time, the cheese develops its characteristic rind and flavor profile. The aging process is carefully monitored to ensure the cheese achieves the desired texture and taste.",
  "flavorProfile": "Alpe Di Frabosa offers a delicate balance of flavors, with a creamy, buttery texture that melts in the mouth. Its taste is mildly tangy with hints of grass and nuts, reflecting the alpine pastures where the cows graze. The aroma is fresh and slightly earthy, with a subtle sweetness that complements its overall flavor profile. When aged, the cheese develops a more robust flavor, with a firmer texture and a deeper, more complex taste.",
  "pairings": "Alpe Di Frabosa pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. For a traditional pairing, enjoy it with crusty bread, fresh fruits like pears and apples, and a glass of light, fruity red wine such as Dolcetto or Barbera. It also complements white wines like Arneis or a crisp, dry cider. For a more innovative approach, try it with honey, nuts, or a drizzle of balsamic glaze. Alpe Di Frabosa can also be used in cooking, adding a creamy richness to dishes like risottos, pasta, and savory tarts.",
