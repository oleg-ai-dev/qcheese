  "description": "Piave Fresco is a semi-hard, artisan cheese made from cow's milk, originating from the Belluno province in the Veneto region of Italy. Named after the Piave River, this cheese is celebrated for its dense texture and pale yellow color. It is typically aged for a shorter period compared to its more mature counterpart, Piave Vecchio, resulting in a milder flavor profile. Piave Fresco is known for its smooth, slightly elastic texture and a thin, natural rind that encases its creamy interior. Its unique characteristics make it a versatile cheese, suitable for a variety of culinary applications.",
  "history": "Piave Fresco has its roots deeply embedded in the Italian cheesemaking tradition, specifically within the Dolomites' foothills. The cheese is a testament to the region's rich dairy heritage, where the pristine waters of the Piave River contribute to the lush pastures that feed the cows. Historically, Piave Fresco was developed as a way to utilize the abundant milk supply in the area, offering a fresher, less aged option to the local population. Over time, it has gained recognition beyond its regional confines, becoming a beloved cheese among connoisseurs for its quality and flavor.",
  "productionProcess": "Piave Fresco is crafted from whole cow's milk, which is first pasteurized and then curdled using natural rennet. The curds are cut, cooked, and pressed into molds, where they are left to drain and form the cheese's characteristic shape. After unmolding, the cheese is salted and aged for a minimum of 20 to 60 days. This relatively short aging period is what distinguishes Piave Fresco from its more aged variants, giving it a softer texture and a milder taste. The production process adheres to strict traditional methods, ensuring the cheese's high quality and distinctive flavor.",
  "flavorProfile": "Piave Fresco offers a delicate and slightly sweet flavor, with hints of fresh milk and a subtle nuttiness. Its aroma is mild and inviting, complementing its smooth, slightly elastic texture. The cheese's flavor becomes more pronounced as it ages, but Piave Fresco maintains a gentle profile that is accessible to a wide range of palates.",
  "pairings": "Piave Fresco pairs beautifully with light-bodied white wines such as Pinot Grigio or Soave, which complement its mild flavor without overpowering it. For beer enthusiasts, a crisp lager or a light ale can be an excellent match. On the food front, Piave Fresco shines on cheese boards accompanied by fresh fruits like pears and apples, or with a drizzle of honey for a touch of sweetness. It also works well in salads, grated over pasta, or melted in sandwiches for a creamy texture.",
