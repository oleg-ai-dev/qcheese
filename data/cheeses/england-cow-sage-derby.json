  "description": "Sage Derby is a distinctive semi-hard cheese originating from England, United Kingdom, known for its unique marbled appearance and herbal flavor. This artisan cheese is made from cow's milk and is characterized by its smooth, slightly crumbly texture and vibrant green veins of sage running throughout. The cheese's appearance is as striking as its taste, with the green sage creating a beautiful contrast against the pale yellow cheese. Sage Derby is celebrated for its ability to blend the traditional flavors of Derby cheese with the aromatic, earthy notes of sage, making it a favorite among those who appreciate cheeses with a herbal twist.",
  "history": "Sage Derby cheese has its roots in the English countryside, where it was first created in the 17th century. It was originally made as a festive cheese, often served during special occasions and holidays. The addition of sage not only added a unique flavor but also gave the cheese a distinctive appearance that made it stand out on the cheese board. Over the centuries, Sage Derby has maintained its status as a beloved artisan cheese, embodying the rich cheesemaking traditions of England. Its cultural significance lies in its ability to combine traditional cheesemaking techniques with innovative flavoring, making it a symbol of English culinary creativity.",
  "productionProcess": "Sage Derby is produced using cow's milk, which is first pasteurized and then curdled using traditional rennet. The curds are cut, drained, and pressed into molds to form the cheese. What sets Sage Derby apart is the addition of sage leaves or sage extract during the curdling process, which infuses the cheese with its characteristic flavor and green marbling. After molding, the cheese is aged for a short period, typically around 1 to 3 months, to develop its flavor and texture. The aging process is carefully monitored to ensure the sage's flavor is well integrated without overpowering the cheese's natural taste.",
  "flavorProfile": "Sage Derby offers a delightful balance of flavors, with the creamy, slightly tangy taste of Derby cheese complemented by the earthy, aromatic notes of sage. The texture is smooth and semi-hard, with a slight crumbliness that adds to its appeal. The aroma is fresh and herbal, with a hint of the countryside that evokes the cheese's English origins. The sage's flavor is present but not overwhelming, making Sage Derby a versatile cheese that can be enjoyed in a variety of culinary contexts.",
  "pairings": "Sage Derby pairs wonderfully with a range of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include crusty bread, crackers, and fresh fruits like apples and pears, which complement its herbal flavor. For a more innovative approach, try pairing it with a light-bodied white wine such as Sauvignon Blanc or a hoppy pale ale to balance its earthy notes. Sage Derby also makes an excellent addition to cheese boards, alongside nuts and honey, or melted into dishes for a flavorful twist. Its unique flavor profile makes it a versatile cheese that can enhance both simple and complex dishes.",
