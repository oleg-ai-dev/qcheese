  "description": "Butte cheese is a soft, soft-ripened cheese originating from France, made exclusively from cow's milk. It is characterized by its creamy texture and bloomy rind, which is typical of soft-ripened cheeses. The rind is edible and adds a subtle earthy flavor to the cheese. Butte cheese is known for its rich, buttery interior that becomes more fluid as it ages, offering a luxurious mouthfeel. Its appearance is marked by a white, velvety rind that encases a pale, creamy interior. This cheese is a testament to the artisanal cheesemaking traditions of France, offering a delicate balance of flavors that are both refined and indulgent.",
  "history": "Butte cheese hails from the rich cheesemaking regions of France, where the tradition of crafting soft-ripened cheeses dates back centuries. While specific historical records of Butte cheese are scarce, it is part of a broader family of French soft cheeses that have been celebrated for their quality and craftsmanship. These cheeses have played a significant role in French culinary culture, often featured in cheese platters and as a key ingredient in various dishes. The production of Butte cheese is a reflection of the meticulous attention to detail and respect for traditional methods that define French cheesemaking.",
  "productionProcess": "Butte cheese is produced using cow's milk, which is carefully selected for its quality and flavor. The milk is gently pasteurized before being inoculated with specific cultures that contribute to the cheese's characteristic flavor and texture. Rennet is added to coagulate the milk, forming curds that are then ladled into molds. The cheese is allowed to drain and form its shape before being treated with Penicillium candidum, which develops the bloomy rind. Aging takes place in controlled environments, where the cheese develops its creamy texture and complex flavors over several weeks.",
  "flavorProfile": "Butte cheese offers a rich and buttery flavor with a hint of earthiness from its bloomy rind. The aroma is mild and inviting, with notes of mushrooms and fresh cream. The texture is luxuriously creamy, becoming almost spoonable as the cheese ages. This combination of flavors and textures makes Butte cheese a delightful experience for the palate, embodying the elegance of French soft-ripened cheeses.",
  "pairings": "Butte cheese pairs wonderfully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include crusty French bread, fresh fruits like apples and pears, and nuts such as walnuts and almonds. For a more innovative approach, try it with honey or fig jam to complement its creamy texture. Wine pairings include Chardonnay or a light Pinot Noir, which balance the cheese's richness. Beer enthusiasts might enjoy a crisp lager or a fruity Belgian ale with Butte cheese. These pairings enhance the cheese's flavors and make for a memorable tasting experience.",
