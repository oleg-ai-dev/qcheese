  "productionProcess": "Shelburne Cheddar is produced using high-quality cow's milk, sourced from local Vermont farms. The milk is carefully pasteurized and then cultured with specific bacteria to develop its flavor. Rennet is added to coagulate the milk, forming curds that are then cut, cooked, and pressed into molds. The cheese is aged for a minimum of several months, during which it develops its characteristic flavor and texture. The aging process is meticulously monitored to ensure the cheese achieves the perfect balance of sharpness and creaminess.",
  "flavorProfile": "Shelburne Cheddar offers a complex flavor profile that is both sharp and nutty, with a slight tanginess that is characteristic of well-aged cheddars. Its aroma is rich and inviting, with hints of grass and earth reflecting its Vermont origins. The texture is firm and slightly crumbly, yet it melts smoothly, making it versatile for various culinary applications.",
  "pairings": "Shelburne Cheddar pairs wonderfully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include crisp apples, crusty bread, and hearty ales. For a more sophisticated experience, try it with a glass of full-bodied red wine, such as a Cabernet Sauvignon or a Merlot. It also complements the flavors of dark chocolate and nuts, making it a great addition to a cheese board. For a unique twist, incorporate Shelburne Cheddar into a grilled cheese sandwich with caramelized onions and a touch of mustard.",
