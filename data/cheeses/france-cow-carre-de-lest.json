  "description": "Carré de L'Est is a soft, creamy cheese originating from the Lorraine region of France. It is made from cow's milk and is known for its square shape, which is somewhat unusual for soft cheeses. The cheese has a bloomy rind that is edible and contributes to its overall flavor profile. Its texture is smooth and spreadable, making it a favorite among those who enjoy rich, buttery cheeses. The interior is pale yellow, offering a stark contrast to its white, velvety rind. Carré de L'Est is often enjoyed for its delicate balance of flavors, which can range from mildly tangy to slightly nutty, depending on its age.",
  "history": "Carré de L'Est has its roots in the Lorraine region of France, an area renowned for its dairy products and cheesemaking traditions. The cheese was developed as a local specialty, embodying the region's rich agricultural heritage. Its square shape is a nod to the traditional forms of cheese produced in the area, distinguishing it from the more common round soft cheeses. Over time, Carré de L'Est has gained recognition beyond its local origins, becoming a cherished choice among cheese enthusiasts for its unique shape and delightful taste.",
  "productionProcess": "Carré de L'Est is made from pasteurized cow's milk, which is curdled using microbial rennet. The curds are then gently ladled into square molds, a process that helps preserve the delicate structure of the cheese. After molding, the cheese is salted and left to age for a short period, typically around two to three weeks. During this time, the cheese develops its characteristic bloomy rind, thanks to the introduction of Penicillium candidum. The aging process is carefully monitored to ensure the cheese achieves the perfect balance of creaminess and flavor.",
  "flavorProfile": "Carré de L'Est offers a complex flavor profile that is both rich and nuanced. The cheese has a creamy, buttery texture that melts in the mouth, releasing a mild tanginess followed by subtle nutty and earthy notes. The bloomy rind adds a slight mushroomy aroma, enhancing the overall sensory experience. Its flavor becomes more pronounced as it ages, developing a deeper, more intense taste.",
  "pairings": "Carré de L'Est pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. For a traditional pairing, enjoy it with a crusty baguette and a glass of Champagne or a light, fruity red wine like Pinot Noir. It also complements fresh fruits such as grapes and apples, as well as nuts and honey for a sweet and savory combination. For a more innovative approach, try incorporating Carré de L'Est into a gourmet grilled cheese sandwich or using it as a luxurious topping for a flatbread pizza.",
