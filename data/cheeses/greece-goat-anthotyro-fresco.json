  "description": "Anthotyro Fresco is a traditional Greek cheese, primarily made from the whey of goat or sheep milk, sometimes with the addition of whole milk. It is a semi-soft cheese, known for its mild, slightly tangy flavor and creamy texture. The cheese is typically white, with a soft and moist appearance, making it a versatile ingredient in various culinary applications. Anthotyro Fresco is often consumed fresh, which contributes to its light and refreshing taste profile. It is a staple in Greek cuisine, appreciated for its simplicity and the subtle flavors it brings to dishes.",
  "history": "Anthotyro Fresco has its roots deeply embedded in Greek culinary tradition, dating back centuries. It originated as a way to utilize the whey byproduct from the production of other cheeses, such as Feta, showcasing the ingenuity of Greek cheesemakers in minimizing waste. This cheese is a testament to the resourcefulness of rural Greek communities, who developed methods to create delicious and nutritious products from available resources. Anthotyro Fresco holds a special place in Greek culture, often associated with home cooking and the simplicity of pastoral life.",
  "productionProcess": "The production of Anthotyro Fresco begins with the whey obtained from goat or sheep milk, sometimes enriched with whole milk to enhance its texture and flavor. The whey is heated, and then an acid or rennet is added to coagulate the proteins, forming curds. These curds are then drained and lightly pressed to remove excess whey, resulting in a semi-soft cheese. Unlike aged cheeses, Anthotyro Fresco is consumed fresh, which means it does not undergo an aging process. This fresh consumption preserves its mild flavor and creamy texture.",
  "flavorProfile": "Anthotyro Fresco is celebrated for its mild, slightly tangy flavor, with a creamy and smooth texture that melts in the mouth. The cheese has a fresh, milky aroma, with subtle hints of the goat or sheep milk from which it is made. Its light and refreshing taste make it a delightful addition to a variety of dishes, offering a gentle contrast to more robust flavors.",
  "pairings": "Anthotyro Fresco pairs wonderfully with a variety of foods and beverages. It complements fresh fruits like figs and grapes, and is excellent with honey and nuts for a simple, yet elegant dessert. In terms of beverages, it goes well with light white wines, such as a crisp Assyrtiko from Greece, or a dry ros√©. For a non-alcoholic option, try pairing it with a sparkling water infused with lemon or cucumber for a refreshing contrast. It also makes a great addition to salads, adding a creamy texture and mild flavor.",
