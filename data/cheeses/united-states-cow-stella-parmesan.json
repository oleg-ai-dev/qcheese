  "description": "Stella Parmesan is a hard, artisan cheese made from cow's milk, originating from the United States. It is known for its granular texture and rich, nutty flavor, which intensifies with age. The cheese typically has a pale yellow color and a hard, crumbly texture, making it ideal for grating over dishes. Stella Parmesan is aged for a minimum of 12 months, allowing it to develop a complex flavor profile that is both savory and slightly sweet. Its robust character makes it a versatile cheese in the kitchen, suitable for both cooking and as a table cheese.",
  "history": "While the specific history of Stella Parmesan is not widely documented, it is part of the broader tradition of Parmesan-style cheeses that have been made for centuries. Parmesan, or Parmigiano-Reggiano, originated in Italy and has been a staple in Italian cuisine since the Middle Ages. Stella Parmesan carries on this tradition in the United States, where artisanal cheesemakers have embraced the techniques and standards of Italian Parmesan production. This cheese represents the growing appreciation for high-quality, artisanal cheeses in the U.S., showcasing the skill and dedication of American cheesemakers.",
  "productionProcess": "Stella Parmesan is made from high-quality cow's milk, which is carefully selected to ensure the best flavor and texture. The milk is heated and then curdled using natural whey and rennet. The curds are cut into small pieces and cooked, then pressed into molds to form the cheese wheels. These wheels are then brined to enhance flavor and preserve the cheese. After brining, Stella Parmesan is aged for at least 12 months in controlled environments, where it develops its characteristic hard texture and complex flavor. The aging process is crucial, as it allows the cheese to develop its signature nutty and savory notes.",
  "flavorProfile": "Stella Parmesan boasts a rich, nutty flavor with a savory depth that is characteristic of well-aged Parmesan-style cheeses. The aroma is intense and slightly fruity, with hints of caramel and toasted nuts. The texture is hard and granular, making it perfect for grating. As it ages, the flavor becomes more pronounced, offering a delightful balance of sweetness and umami.",
  "pairings": "Stella Parmesan pairs wonderfully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include Italian dishes such as pasta, risotto, and salads. It also complements fruits like pears and apples, as well as nuts and honey for a delightful cheese board. For beverages, try it with a full-bodied red wine like Chianti or a crisp white wine such as Pinot Grigio. Beer enthusiasts might enjoy it with a malty amber ale or a hoppy IPA. For a unique twist, pair Stella Parmesan with a dark chocolate for a surprising and delicious combination.",
