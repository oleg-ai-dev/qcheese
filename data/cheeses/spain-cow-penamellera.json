  "description": "Penamellera cheese is a semi-hard, artisan cheese originating from the Asturias region in northern Spain. It is traditionally made from a blend of cow, goat, and sheep milk, which contributes to its complex flavor profile. The cheese has a firm yet slightly elastic texture, with a natural rind that may develop a light bloom of mold as it ages. Its interior is pale yellow, with small, irregular eyes scattered throughout. Penamellera is known for its balanced taste, which combines the richness of cow milk with the tanginess of goat and sheep milk, making it a versatile cheese for various culinary uses.",
  "history": "Penamellera cheese has its roots in the pastoral traditions of the Asturias region, where dairy farming has been a way of life for centuries. Named after the Penamellera valley, this cheese reflects the area's commitment to artisanal cheesemaking. Historically, it was produced by local farmers to preserve surplus milk. Over time, it gained recognition for its unique blend of milks and traditional production methods. Today, it remains a symbol of Asturian heritage and is celebrated in local festivals and markets.",
  "productionProcess": "Penamellera cheese is crafted using raw or pasteurized milk from cows, goats, and sheep. The milk is gently heated and curdled using animal rennet. The curds are then cut, drained, and pressed into molds to form the cheese. After unmolding, the cheese is salted and aged for a minimum of two months, during which it develops its characteristic texture and flavor. The aging process takes place in cool, humid cellars, allowing the cheese to mature naturally.",
  "flavorProfile": "Penamellera cheese offers a harmonious blend of flavors, with a creamy, slightly nutty base complemented by tangy and earthy undertones. Its aroma is mild yet complex, with hints of grass and hay. The texture is firm and smooth, with a pleasant melt-in-the-mouth quality that makes it highly enjoyable.",
  "pairings": "Penamellera cheese pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include crusty bread, quince paste, and cured meats like chorizo. For drinks, try it with a crisp Spanish cider, a light red wine such as Tempranillo, or a hoppy IPA. It also works well in salads, grated over roasted vegetables, or melted into a savory tart.",
