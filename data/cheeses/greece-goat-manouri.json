  "description": "Manouri is a luxurious, semi-soft whey cheese originating from Greece, crafted from the whey of goat's or sheep's milk used in feta production. It boasts a creamy, smooth texture and a pristine white appearance, often shaped into logs or blocks. Unlike many whey cheeses, Manouri is enriched with milk or cream, elevating its richness and making it a decadent addition to any cheese platter. Its mild, slightly tangy flavor and velvety consistency make it a versatile cheese, beloved in both traditional Greek cuisine and modern culinary creations.",
  "history": "Manouri's roots are deeply embedded in Greek cheesemaking traditions, where it emerged as a byproduct of feta production. Artisans, not wanting to waste the nutritious whey leftover from feta, began crafting Manouri, adding milk or cream to create a richer, more indulgent cheese. This practice highlights the resourcefulness of Greek cheesemakers and their commitment to sustainability. Over time, Manouri has gained recognition for its unique qualities, becoming a cherished component of Greek gastronomy and a symbol of the country's rich dairy heritage.",
  "productionProcess": "Manouri is produced by heating the whey left over from feta cheese production, then adding fresh goat's or sheep's milk or cream to enrich the mixture. The curds are gently cooked and then drained, often molded into logs or blocks. Unlike aged cheeses, Manouri is typically consumed fresh, which preserves its soft texture and delicate flavor. This process not only utilizes the byproducts of cheesemaking but also results in a cheese that is both sustainable and delicious.",
  "flavorProfile": "Manouri offers a delicate balance of flavors, with a mild tanginess complemented by a creamy, buttery richness. Its aroma is fresh and slightly milky, inviting and not overpowering. The texture is smooth and spreadable, making it a joy to eat on its own or as part of a dish. Its subtle flavor profile makes it an excellent canvas for both sweet and savory pairings.",
  "pairings": "Manouri pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. For a traditional Greek experience, serve it with honey and walnuts, or incorporate it into a salad with fresh vegetables and olives. Wine enthusiasts will appreciate its harmony with crisp white wines, such as Assyrtiko or Sauvignon Blanc, which complement its creamy texture and tangy notes. For a more casual pairing, try it with a light beer or a sparkling water infused with citrus. Manouri also shines in desserts, especially when paired with fruits like figs or pears.",
