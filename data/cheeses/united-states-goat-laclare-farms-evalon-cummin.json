  "history": "Laclare Farms, located in Wisconsin, is renowned for its commitment to sustainable farming and artisanal cheese production. The Evalon Cummin cheese is a testament to the farm's innovative approach, blending traditional cheesemaking techniques with unique flavor profiles. While not as widely documented as some European cheeses, Evalon Cummin has gained a loyal following among cheese enthusiasts in the United States. Its creation reflects a broader trend in American artisanal cheesemaking, where producers experiment with local ingredients and global influences to craft distinctive cheeses.",
  "productionProcess": "Evalon Cummin is made from high-quality goat milk, which is gently pasteurized to ensure safety while preserving the milk's natural flavors. The milk is then curdled using traditional rennet, and the curds are cut, drained, and pressed to form the cheese. Cumin seeds are added during the curdling process, ensuring an even distribution of flavor. The cheese is aged for several weeks to develop its semi-hard texture and complex flavor profile. The aging process takes place in carefully controlled environments to maintain the cheese's quality and character.",
  "flavorProfile": "Evalon Cummin offers a harmonious blend of tangy goat milk and the warm, earthy notes of cumin. The cheese has a creamy yet firm texture, with a slightly crumbly finish. Its aroma is inviting, with hints of spice and a subtle goaty tang. The cumin seeds add a pleasant crunch and enhance the overall flavor, making it a memorable and versatile cheese.",
  "pairings": "Evalon Cummin pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. For a traditional pairing, try it with crusty bread, olives, and cured meats. Its bold flavor complements the sweetness of dried fruits like apricots or figs. Wine enthusiasts will appreciate it with a crisp Sauvignon Blanc or a light-bodied red like Pinot Noir. Beer lovers can enjoy it with a wheat beer or a spiced ale. For a unique twist, incorporate it into Middle Eastern-inspired dishes, where its cumin flavor will shine.",
