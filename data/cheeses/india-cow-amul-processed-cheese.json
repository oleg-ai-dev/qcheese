  "description": "Amul Processed Cheese is a popular cheese variety originating from India, known for its versatility and widespread use in Indian cuisine. Made from a blend of cow and water buffalo milk, this cheese is characterized by its firm, hard texture and smooth, uniform appearance. It is a processed cheese, which means it has been pasteurized and blended with emulsifiers to create a consistent and melt-friendly product. Amul Processed Cheese is celebrated for its mild, creamy flavor and its ability to retain shape when heated, making it a staple in both traditional and modern Indian dishes. Its affordability and long shelf life have contributed to its popularity across the country.",
  "history": "Amul Processed Cheese was introduced by the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd. (GCMMF), which is also behind the iconic Amul brand. Launched in the mid-20th century, it was one of the first processed cheeses to be widely available in India. The cheese was developed to cater to the growing demand for a versatile, shelf-stable dairy product that could be used in a variety of culinary applications. Over the years, it has become a household name, deeply embedded in Indian food culture. Its introduction marked a significant moment in the industrialization of dairy products in India, making cheese accessible to a broader audience.",
  "productionProcess": "Amul Processed Cheese is made by blending high-quality cow and water buffalo milk. The milk is pasteurized to ensure safety and then curdled using microbial rennet. The curds are pressed to remove excess whey, resulting in a firm texture. The cheese is then processed by heating and mixing with emulsifying salts, which give it a smooth, uniform consistency. This process also enhances its melting properties, making it ideal for cooking. The cheese is molded, packaged, and often vacuum-sealed to extend its shelf life without the need for refrigeration until opened.",
  "flavorProfile": "Amul Processed Cheese has a mild, creamy flavor with a slight tanginess. Its aroma is subtle, with a fresh dairy scent. The texture is firm yet smooth, making it easy to slice or grate. When melted, it becomes creamy and velvety, adding richness to dishes without overpowering other flavors.",
  "pairings": "Amul Processed Cheese pairs well with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include Indian flatbreads like naan or paratha, as well as spicy curries where its mild flavor balances the heat. It also works beautifully in grilled cheese sandwiches, pizzas, and pasta dishes. For drinks, try pairing it with light beers, crisp white wines like Sauvignon Blanc, or even a cup of masala chai for a quintessentially Indian experience.",
