  "description": "St Tola Cranberry is a unique artisan cheese from Ireland, made from goat's milk. This fresh, soft cheese is distinguished by its creamy texture and the vibrant addition of cranberries, which provide a sweet and tangy contrast to the cheese's natural tartness. The cheese has a soft, spreadable consistency, making it a delightful addition to any cheese board. Its appearance is marked by the speckles of cranberry throughout the pale, creamy cheese, offering a visually appealing and flavorful experience. St Tola Cranberry is a testament to the innovative spirit of Irish cheesemaking, combining traditional techniques with creative flavor additions.",
  "history": "St Tola Cranberry cheese originates from the St Tola Goat Cheese company, located in the heart of County Clare, Ireland. The company has been producing high-quality goat cheeses since the 1980s, focusing on sustainable farming and artisanal cheesemaking practices. The addition of cranberries to their fresh goat cheese is a relatively recent innovation, designed to offer a unique flavor profile that complements the natural qualities of goat's milk. This cheese reflects the growing trend in the artisanal cheese industry towards incorporating fruits and other flavorings to create distinctive and memorable products.",
  "productionProcess": "St Tola Cranberry cheese is made from pasteurized goat's milk, which is carefully selected for its quality and flavor. The milk is curdled using traditional methods, and the curds are gently handled to preserve the cheese's soft texture. After the initial curdling process, cranberries are added to the cheese, which is then shaped and allowed to mature for a short period. This brief aging process ensures the cheese retains its fresh, creamy consistency while allowing the flavors to meld together beautifully. The result is a cheese that is both traditional in its base and innovative in its flavor profile.",
  "flavorProfile": "St Tola Cranberry cheese offers a delightful balance of flavors. The base of the cheese is creamy and tangy, characteristic of high-quality goat cheese, while the cranberries add a sweet and slightly tart contrast. The texture is soft and spreadable, making it a pleasure to eat. The aroma is fresh and inviting, with a hint of the tanginess from the goat's milk and the sweetness of the cranberries. This cheese is a perfect example of how the addition of fruit can enhance and complement the natural flavors of cheese.",
  "pairings": "St Tola Cranberry cheese pairs wonderfully with a variety of foods and beverages. For a traditional pairing, serve it with a crisp white wine or a light, fruity red wine that can complement the cheese's tanginess and the sweetness of the cranberries. It also goes well with a range of beers, particularly those with a slight fruitiness or a crisp finish. For food pairings, consider serving it with crackers, fresh bread, or as part of a cheese board with nuts and dried fruits. It can also be used in salads or as a topping for bruschetta, adding a unique flavor to these dishes.",
