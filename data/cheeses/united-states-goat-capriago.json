  "description": "Capriago is a distinctive artisan cheese originating from the United States, crafted exclusively from goat's milk. This hard, brined cheese is celebrated for its unique texture and flavor profile, making it a standout choice among cheese aficionados. The cheese's appearance is characterized by a firm, dense texture and a natural rind that may develop a slight bloom over time, depending on the aging process. Capriago's production involves a meticulous brining technique, which not only preserves the cheese but also imparts a subtle saltiness that enhances its overall flavor. Its artisanal nature means each batch can have slight variations, adding to its charm and appeal.",
  "history": "Capriago cheese is a relatively new addition to the American artisan cheese scene, reflecting the growing interest in and appreciation for high-quality, locally produced cheeses. Its creation is a testament to the innovation and dedication of American cheesemakers who are exploring traditional methods with a modern twist. While it may not have a long historical lineage like some European cheeses, Capriago is quickly gaining recognition for its quality and unique characteristics. It represents the evolving palate of American consumers and the cheesemakers' commitment to sustainability and artisanal craftsmanship.",
  "productionProcess": "Capriago is made from 100% goat's milk, which is known for its rich, tangy flavor profile. The milk is carefully curdled using traditional methods, and the curds are then pressed to remove excess whey, resulting in a dense, hard cheese. Following this, the cheese undergoes a brining process, where it is submerged in a saltwater solution for a period that can vary depending on the desired intensity of flavor. This brining not only seasons the cheese but also aids in its preservation. After brining, Capriago is aged for several months, during which it develops a complex flavor and a firm texture. The aging environment is carefully controlled to ensure the cheese matures perfectly.",
  "flavorProfile": "Capriago boasts a rich and tangy flavor profile, with a pronounced goat's milk character that is both sharp and slightly sweet. The brining process adds a subtle saltiness that balances the cheese's natural tang, while the aging contributes to a nutty, complex depth of flavor. Its texture is firm yet creamy, allowing it to melt beautifully when heated. The aroma is distinctly earthy, with hints of grass and hay, reflecting the goat's milk origin.",
  "pairings": "Capriago pairs wonderfully with a variety of foods and beverages. For a traditional pairing, try it with a crisp, dry white wine such as Sauvignon Blanc, which complements its tangy flavor. It also goes well with light, fruity reds like Pinot Noir. Beer enthusiasts might enjoy it with a hoppy IPA or a smooth wheat beer. On the food side, Capriago is excellent on a cheese board accompanied by fresh fruits like pears and apples, nuts, and honey. It can also be used in cooking, adding depth to dishes like risottos or salads.",
