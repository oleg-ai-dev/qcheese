  "description": "Sartori Classic Cheese Romano is a hard, artisan cheese crafted in the United States, specifically designed to pay homage to the traditional Italian Romano cheeses. Made from cow's milk, this cheese boasts a firm and granular texture, making it ideal for grating over dishes. Its appearance is characterized by a natural, golden rind that encases a pale yellow interior. The cheese is aged for a minimum of 10 months, allowing it to develop a robust flavor profile that is both tangy and slightly nutty. Sartori's commitment to quality and craftsmanship is evident in every bite, making it a standout choice for those seeking a domestic alternative to imported Romano cheeses.",
  "history": "Sartori Classic Cheese Romano is a product of Sartori Company, a family-owned cheese manufacturer based in Plymouth, Wisconsin. The company has been producing cheese since 1939, with a focus on blending traditional European cheesemaking techniques with innovative American craftsmanship. The Classic Cheese Romano was developed to offer a high-quality, domestically produced alternative to the traditional Italian Romano cheeses, which are often made from sheep's milk. Sartori's version uses cow's milk, making it more accessible while still maintaining a rich, complex flavor. Over the years, Sartori has gained a reputation for its dedication to quality and sustainability, earning numerous awards for its cheeses.",
  "productionProcess": "Sartori Classic Cheese Romano begins with high-quality cow's milk, which is carefully selected to ensure a rich and creamy base. The milk is pasteurized and then curdled using traditional methods, involving the addition of rennet and starter cultures. The curds are cut, cooked, and pressed to remove excess whey, resulting in a firm texture. The cheese is then salted and aged for a minimum of 10 months in controlled environments to develop its characteristic flavor and texture. During the aging process, the cheese is regularly turned and monitored to ensure even maturation. This meticulous process results in a cheese that is both flavorful and versatile.",
  "flavorProfile": "Sartori Classic Cheese Romano offers a bold and tangy flavor with a slightly nutty undertone. Its firm, granular texture makes it perfect for grating, and it delivers a satisfying crunch when bitten into. The aroma is rich and earthy, with hints of caramel and toasted nuts. The cheese's long aging process contributes to its complex flavor profile, making it a standout choice for those who appreciate robust, full-bodied cheeses.",
  "pairings": "Sartori Classic Cheese Romano pairs wonderfully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include pasta dishes, where it can be grated over spaghetti carbonara or baked into lasagna. It also complements hearty soups and stews, adding a depth of flavor. For wine pairings, opt for bold reds like Chianti or Barolo, which can stand up to the cheese's robust flavor. Beer enthusiasts might enjoy it with a malty amber ale or a crisp pilsner. For a unique twist, try pairing it with honey or fig jam to balance its tanginess.",
