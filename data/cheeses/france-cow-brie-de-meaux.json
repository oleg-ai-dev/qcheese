  "description": "Brie de Meaux is a quintessential French cheese, hailing from the Île-de-France region, specifically around the town of Meaux. This soft-ripened cheese is celebrated for its creamy texture and bloomy rind, which is edible and adds a subtle earthy flavor. The interior, or paste, is soft and buttery, becoming runnier as it ages. Brie de Meaux is distinguished by its large wheel size, typically around 35-37 cm in diameter, and its rich, complex flavor profile that balances creamy, nutty, and slightly tangy notes. It holds a prestigious AOC (Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée) designation, ensuring its production adheres to strict traditional methods.",
  "history": "Brie de Meaux's history dates back to the Middle Ages, where it was revered by French royalty, including Charlemagne and Louis XVI. Its origins are deeply rooted in the Brie region, where the fertile lands provided ideal conditions for dairy farming. The cheese gained fame for its exquisite taste and texture, becoming a symbol of French gastronomy. Over centuries, Brie de Meaux has maintained its artisanal production methods, preserving its status as a cheese of unparalleled quality and heritage.",
  "productionProcess": "Brie de Meaux is made from raw cow's milk, which is gently heated and then curdled using rennet. The curds are hand-ladled into molds, a traditional technique that ensures a delicate texture. After draining, the cheese is salted and inoculated with Penicillium candidum, which forms the characteristic white rind. Aging takes place in humid cellars for at least four weeks, during which the cheese develops its complex flavors and creamy consistency. The AOC regulations mandate that Brie de Meaux must be produced within a specific geographic area and follow these time-honored methods.",
  "flavorProfile": "Brie de Meaux offers a luxurious sensory experience. Its aroma is earthy and mushroom-like, with hints of butter and cream. The flavor is rich and creamy, with a balance of nutty, tangy, and slightly sweet notes. The texture is velvety and smooth, becoming almost liquid at room temperature. The rind adds a subtle earthy contrast, enhancing the overall complexity.",
  "pairings": "Brie de Meaux pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include crusty baguettes, fresh fruits like apples and pears, and nuts such as walnuts. For drinks, it complements Champagne, Chardonnay, or a light Pinot Noir. Beer enthusiasts might enjoy it with a Belgian-style ale. For a modern twist, try it with honey or fig jam, or incorporate it into a gourmet grilled cheese sandwich.",
