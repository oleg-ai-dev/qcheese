  "description": "Classics Fresh Mozzarella is a soft, brined cheese made from cow's milk, originating from the United States. It is known for its high moisture content, which gives it a tender, slightly elastic texture. The cheese is typically formed into balls or logs and is often stored in a light brine to maintain its freshness and softness. Its appearance is a pure, milky white, with a smooth, shiny surface that is inviting to the eye. Classics Fresh Mozzarella is celebrated for its mild, milky flavor and its versatility in both cold and cooked dishes.",
  "history": "Fresh Mozzarella has its roots in Italy, where it was traditionally made from the milk of water buffaloes. The American version, Classics Fresh Mozzarella, adapts this traditional cheese to the tastes and production capabilities of the United States, using cow's milk. This adaptation has made fresh mozzarella more accessible to a wider audience, allowing it to become a staple in American kitchens. Its introduction has played a significant role in popularizing Italian cuisine in the U.S., particularly in dishes like pizza and caprese salad.",
  "productionProcess": "Classics Fresh Mozzarella is made by curdling cow's milk with rennet, a natural enzyme that causes the milk to separate into curds and whey. The curds are then heated and stretched, a process that gives mozzarella its characteristic texture. After stretching, the cheese is formed into its final shape and submerged in a brine solution. This brining process not only adds a slight saltiness to the cheese but also helps to preserve its moisture and freshness. The entire process is designed to be completed quickly, ensuring the cheese retains its soft, fresh qualities.",
  "flavorProfile": "Classics Fresh Mozzarella boasts a mild, milky flavor with a slight tanginess and a hint of salt from the brine. Its texture is soft and moist, with a delicate elasticity that makes it a joy to eat. The cheese has a clean, fresh aroma that complements its light taste profile.",
  "pairings": "Classics Fresh Mozzarella pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. It is a classic choice for caprese salad, paired with ripe tomatoes, fresh basil, and a drizzle of olive oil. It also melts wonderfully, making it ideal for pizzas and baked pasta dishes. For wine pairings, a light, crisp white wine like Pinot Grigio complements its mild flavor, while a pale ale can enhance its freshness in beer pairings. Fresh fruits, crusty bread, and cured meats are also excellent accompaniments.",
