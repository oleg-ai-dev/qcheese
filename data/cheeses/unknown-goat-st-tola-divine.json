  "description": "St Tola Divine is an exquisite artisan goat cheese, celebrated for its creamy texture and delicate flavor. Originating from the lush pastures of Ireland, this cheese is a testament to the art of traditional cheesemaking. It boasts a soft, spreadable texture with a pristine white rind that encases a lush, ivory interior. The cheese is known for its subtle tanginess, balanced by a mild, earthy undertone, making it a versatile choice for various culinary applications. Its artisanal nature ensures each batch carries a unique character, reflecting the seasonal variations in the goats' diet.",
  "history": "St Tola Divine cheese is produced by St Tola Goat Cheese, a renowned cheesemaker located in the heart of County Clare, Ireland. The farm has been at the forefront of the Irish artisan cheese movement, championing sustainable farming practices and traditional cheesemaking techniques. The Divine variant is a relatively recent addition to their lineup, designed to offer a fresher, softer option that complements their range of aged goat cheeses. It embodies the rich dairy heritage of Ireland, showcasing the potential of goat milk in creating sophisticated, artisanal cheeses.",
  "productionProcess": "St Tola Divine is crafted from the fresh milk of pasture-fed goats, ensuring a high-quality base for the cheese. The milk is gently pasteurized before being inoculated with specific cultures to start the fermentation process. Rennet is then added to coagulate the milk, forming curds that are carefully ladled into molds. The cheese is allowed to drain naturally, preserving its soft texture. It undergoes a brief aging period, during which it develops its characteristic rind and flavor profile. The entire process is carried out with meticulous attention to detail, reflecting the artisanal ethos of the cheesemaker.",
  "flavorProfile": "St Tola Divine offers a harmonious blend of flavors, with a pronounced creaminess that melts in the mouth. It has a mild tanginess, characteristic of goat cheese, complemented by a subtle earthiness and a hint of fresh herbs. The aroma is fresh and inviting, with a slight lactic sharpness that enhances its overall appeal. The texture is luxuriously soft and spreadable, making it a delight to eat on its own or as part of a dish.",
  "pairings": "St Tola Divine pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. For a classic combination, serve it with crusty bread and a drizzle of honey to highlight its creamy texture and tangy flavor. It also complements fresh fruits like figs and pears, adding a refreshing contrast. In terms of drinks, a crisp white wine such as Sauvignon Blanc or a light, citrusy beer can enhance the cheese's delicate flavors. For a non-alcoholic option, a sparkling apple cider offers a delightful pairing.",
