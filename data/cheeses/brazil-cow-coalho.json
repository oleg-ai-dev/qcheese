  "description": "Coalho cheese is a traditional Brazilian semi-hard cheese, primarily made from cow's milk. It is known for its firm yet slightly elastic texture, which makes it ideal for grilling or frying without melting away. The cheese typically has a pale yellow color and a smooth, slightly waxy rind. Its unique characteristic is its ability to hold shape under heat, making it a favorite in Brazilian cuisine for dishes that require cheese to be cooked directly over flames or in a pan. Coalho cheese has a mild, slightly tangy flavor that becomes more pronounced when heated, offering a delightful contrast to its subtle saltiness.",
  "history": "Coalho cheese has its roots deeply embedded in Brazilian rural traditions, where it has been a staple for centuries. Originating from the Northeast region of Brazil, it was traditionally made by local farmers using simple, artisanal methods. The cheese's name, 'Coalho,' refers to the rennet used in the cheese-making process, highlighting its traditional production techniques. Over time, Coalho cheese has become a symbol of Brazilian culinary heritage, celebrated for its versatility and unique cooking properties. It plays a significant role in local festivals and gatherings, often served grilled as a popular street food.",
  "productionProcess": "Coalho cheese is produced using cow's milk, which is first pasteurized and then curdled using animal rennet. The curds are cut, gently heated, and pressed into molds to form the cheese's characteristic shape. After molding, the cheese is salted and left to age for a short period, typically a few weeks, which contributes to its semi-hard texture and mild flavor. The aging process is crucial for developing the cheese's ability to withstand high temperatures without losing its form, a distinctive feature of Coalho cheese.",
  "flavorProfile": "Coalho cheese offers a mild, slightly tangy flavor with a subtle saltiness that enhances its overall taste. When heated, it develops a richer, more pronounced flavor, with a delightful contrast between its creamy interior and slightly crispy exterior. The aroma is mild and inviting, with a fresh, milky scent that becomes more aromatic when grilled or fried.",
  "pairings": "Coalho cheese pairs wonderfully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditionally, it is served grilled with a drizzle of honey or alongside fresh fruits like mango and pineapple for a sweet and savory combination. It also complements robust red wines and light beers, which balance its mild flavor. For a more innovative pairing, try Coalho cheese with spicy sauces or incorporate it into salads for added texture and flavor. Its versatility makes it an excellent addition to cheese boards, offering a unique Brazilian twist.",
