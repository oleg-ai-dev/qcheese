  "description": "Cotherstone cheese is a traditional, semi-hard artisan cheese originating from the village of Cotherstone in County Durham, England. Made from cow's milk, it boasts a firm yet slightly crumbly texture, with a natural rind that develops a rustic, earthy appearance as it ages. The cheese is known for its mild, nutty flavor with subtle grassy undertones, reflecting the lush pastures of its origin. Cotherstone is often compared to Wensleydale but has a distinct character due to its unique production methods and aging process. It is a versatile cheese, perfect for cheese boards, cooking, or enjoying on its own.",
  "history": "Cotherstone cheese has its roots in the rural cheesemaking traditions of Northern England, particularly in the Teesdale region. It was traditionally made by farmers using surplus milk from their herds. The cheese gained local fame for its quality and flavor, becoming a staple in the region. While it never achieved the widespread recognition of some other British cheeses, it remains a cherished part of County Durham's culinary heritage. Its production has seen a revival in recent years, thanks to the efforts of artisanal cheesemakers dedicated to preserving traditional methods.",
  "productionProcess": "Cotherstone cheese is made from pasteurized cow's milk, which is gently heated and curdled using rennet. The curds are cut, drained, and pressed into molds to form the characteristic wheel shape. The cheese is then aged for several weeks to develop its flavor and texture. During aging, it is regularly turned and brushed to encourage the formation of its natural rind. The process is entirely artisanal, with a focus on preserving the traditional techniques that give Cotherstone its unique character.",
  "flavorProfile": "Cotherstone cheese offers a delicate, nutty flavor with hints of grass and a slight tanginess. Its texture is semi-hard, with a crumbly yet creamy mouthfeel. The natural rind adds a subtle earthy note, enhancing the overall complexity. The cheese is neither too sharp nor too mild, making it an excellent choice for those who appreciate balanced flavors.",
  "pairings": "Cotherstone pairs beautifully with crisp white wines like Sauvignon Blanc or light reds such as Pinot Noir. For beer lovers, a pale ale or a fruity cider complements its nutty notes. On a cheese board, it pairs well with fresh fruits like apples and pears, as well as honey or chutney. For a savory twist, try it with crusty bread and cured meats. Its versatility also makes it a great addition to salads or melted into a hearty soup.",
