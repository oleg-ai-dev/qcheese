  "description": "Cornish Yarg is a distinctive artisan cheese originating from Cornwall, England. It is a semi-hard cheese made from cow's milk, known for its unique rind wrapped in nettle leaves, which not only imparts a striking appearance but also contributes to its flavor and texture. The cheese has a creamy, slightly crumbly texture beneath the rind, with a mild, tangy flavor that becomes more pronounced as it ages. The nettle wrapping also encourages the growth of beneficial molds, adding complexity to its taste profile.",
  "history": "Cornish Yarg's history is relatively modern compared to many traditional cheeses, with its origins tracing back to the 1970s. It was inspired by a 13th-century recipe discovered by the Gray family, from whom the cheese gets its name (Yarg is Gray spelled backward). The revival of this cheese by the Gray family and its subsequent production by Lynher Dairies have made it a celebrated part of Cornwall's artisanal cheese scene. Its unique nettle wrapping is a nod to traditional methods of preserving and flavoring cheese, showcasing the innovative spirit of modern British cheesemaking.",
  "productionProcess": "Cornish Yarg is made from pasteurized cow's milk, which is curdled using vegetarian rennet. The curds are then pressed into molds and left to mature. The distinctive feature of Cornish Yarg is its wrapping in nettle leaves, which are hand-picked and carefully applied to the cheese. This not only gives the cheese its characteristic appearance but also influences its aging process, as the leaves encourage the growth of natural molds that contribute to the cheese's flavor and texture. The cheese is aged for several weeks to develop its full flavor profile.",
  "flavorProfile": "Cornish Yarg offers a mild, tangy flavor with a creamy, slightly crumbly texture. The nettle wrapping imparts a subtle, earthy taste and a slightly mushroomy aroma. As the cheese ages, the flavors become more pronounced, with a balance of creaminess and a hint of sharpness. The rind adds a unique texture and depth to the overall tasting experience.",
  "pairings": "Cornish Yarg pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and drinks. Traditional pairings include crusty bread, fresh fruits like apples and pears, and a selection of nuts. For beverages, it complements crisp white wines such as Sauvignon Blanc or a light, hoppy beer. Innovative pairings might include a drizzle of honey or a spread of fig jam to enhance its earthy flavors. It also works well in salads or as part of a cheese platter with other British cheeses.",
