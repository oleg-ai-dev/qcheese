Its creation reflects a commitment to sustainability and the use of locally sourced ingredients, embodying the spirit of Irish artisanal food production.",
  "productionProcess": "Bluebell Falls Cygnus is made from pasteurized goat's milk, which is gently curdled using vegetarian rennet. The curds are then carefully handled to preserve their delicate structure, resulting in a soft, spreadable cheese. The cheese is typically aged for a short period, just enough to develop its characteristic flavor and texture. The production process emphasizes minimal intervention, allowing the natural qualities of the goat's milk to shine through. This approach ensures that each batch of Bluebell Falls Cygnus retains a unique, artisanal character.",
