  "description": "Bra cheese, originating from the Piedmont region of Italy, is a hard cow's milk cheese known for its robust flavor and firm texture. It comes in two varieties: Bra Tenero (young and semi-soft) and Bra Duro (aged and hard). The cheese has a natural rind that ranges from pale yellow to brown, depending on its age. Its interior is compact and straw-colored, with a slightly granular texture that becomes more pronounced with aging. Bra cheese is celebrated for its versatility and depth of flavor, making it a staple in Italian cheesemaking traditions.",
  "history": "Bra cheese has its roots in the town of Bra in the Piedmont region of Italy, dating back to the Middle Ages. It was traditionally made by local farmers as a way to preserve milk. Over time, it gained popularity across Italy and became a symbol of Piedmontese culinary heritage. The cheese is named after its town of origin, which is also famous for hosting the international cheese festival, Cheese. Bra cheese reflects the region's pastoral traditions and its commitment to artisanal cheesemaking.",
  "productionProcess": "Bra cheese is made from whole cow's milk, which is heated and curdled using natural rennet. The curds are cut, pressed, and molded into wheels, then salted either by brining or dry salting. The aging process varies: Bra Tenero is aged for 45 days, while Bra Duro is aged for at least 6 months. During aging, the cheese develops its characteristic texture and flavor. The wheels are regularly turned and brushed to maintain quality.",
  "flavorProfile": "Bra Tenero has a mild, buttery flavor with a slightly tangy finish, while Bra Duro is more intense, nutty, and savory, with a crumbly texture. Both varieties have a rich, earthy aroma that deepens with age. The cheese's complexity makes it a favorite among connoisseurs.",
  "pairings": "Bra cheese pairs beautifully with full-bodied red wines like Barolo or Barbera, which complement its robust flavor. For beer lovers, a malty ale or stout works well. Serve it with honey, dried fruits, or crusty bread for a classic pairing. It also shines in dishes like risotto or grated over pasta.",
