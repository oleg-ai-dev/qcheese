  "description": "Shanklish is a traditional Middle Eastern cheese, primarily found in Egypt, Lebanon, and Syria. It is made from cow's or sheep's milk and is known for its firm to hard texture. The cheese is often shaped into small balls or patties and can be aged, which intensifies its flavor. Shanklish has a distinctive appearance, usually coated with thyme, za'atar, or chili powder, giving it a unique and aromatic crust. This cheese is celebrated for its versatility and is a staple in many Middle Eastern households.",
  "history": "Shanklish has a rich history rooted in the pastoral traditions of the Middle East. It is believed to have originated among the Bedouin communities, who needed a durable cheese that could withstand the harsh desert climate. Over time, Shanklish became a beloved part of the culinary landscape in Egypt, Lebanon, and Syria, often served as part of mezze platters or used in traditional dishes. Its production methods have been passed down through generations, preserving its artisanal quality and cultural significance.",
  "productionProcess": "Shanklish is made by curdling cow's or sheep's milk using natural rennet. The curds are then drained and pressed to form a firm cheese. After the initial formation, the cheese is often rolled into balls or shaped into patties and left to age. During the aging process, which can last from a few weeks to several months, the cheese develops a harder texture and more complex flavors. The final step involves coating the cheese in a mixture of herbs and spices, such as thyme or za'atar, which not only adds flavor but also helps preserve the cheese.",
  "flavorProfile": "Shanklish offers a robust and tangy flavor, with a slightly salty and spicy kick from its herb and spice coating. The texture can range from firm to hard, depending on the aging period. Its aroma is earthy and aromatic, thanks to the thyme or za'atar crust. The cheese's flavor intensifies with age, making it a favorite among those who appreciate bold and complex tastes.",
  "pairings": "Shanklish pairs wonderfully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditionally, it is served with fresh vegetables, olives, and flatbreads as part of a mezze platter. It also complements hearty dishes like stews and grilled meats. For drinks, try pairing Shanklish with a crisp white wine, such as Sauvignon Blanc, or a light beer. The cheese's bold flavors also stand up well to robust red wines and aromatic teas.",
