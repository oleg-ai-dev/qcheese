  "description": "Piave Vecchio is a distinguished hard cheese hailing from the Belluno province in the Veneto region of Italy, crafted exclusively from cow's milk. This artisan cheese is named after the Piave River, which runs through the area, symbolizing the deep connection between the product and its terroir. Piave Vecchio is aged for over 6 months, developing a dense, compact texture that is slightly crumbly yet smooth. Its rind is hard and straw-colored, encasing a pale yellow interior. The cheese is celebrated for its rich, nutty flavor and a hint of sweetness, making it a versatile choice for various culinary applications.",
  "history": "Piave Vecchio's roots are deeply embedded in the pastoral traditions of the Dolomites' foothills, where dairy farming has been a way of life for centuries. The cheese was officially recognized with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status in 2010, safeguarding its traditional production methods and regional authenticity. Piave Vecchio is a testament to the artisanal cheesemaking heritage of the Veneto region, embodying the flavors and aromas of its alpine pastures. Its creation is a meticulous process that has been passed down through generations, ensuring that each wheel of cheese carries the legacy of its origins.",
  "productionProcess": "Piave Vecchio is made from whole cow's milk, which is heated and then curdled using natural whey starter and calf rennet. The curds are cut into small granules, cooked, and then pressed into molds to form the cheese's characteristic shape. After brining, the cheese is aged for a minimum of 6 months, during which it develops its distinctive flavor and texture. The aging process takes place in temperature and humidity-controlled environments, allowing the cheese to mature gracefully and acquire its complex flavor profile.",
  "flavorProfile": "Piave Vecchio offers a rich and complex flavor profile, characterized by a pronounced nuttiness with hints of caramel and a subtle sweetness. Its aroma is inviting, with earthy and buttery notes. The texture is firm and slightly crumbly, yet it melts smoothly, making it a delight both on the palate and in cooking.",
  "pairings": "Piave Vecchio pairs beautifully with full-bodied red wines such as Amarone or Barolo, which complement its rich flavor. For beer enthusiasts, a malty amber ale or a crisp pilsner can enhance the cheese's nutty notes. On the food front, it pairs wonderfully with cured meats, figs, and walnuts. For a simple yet elegant presentation, serve it with a drizzle of honey or alongside a slice of rustic bread.",
