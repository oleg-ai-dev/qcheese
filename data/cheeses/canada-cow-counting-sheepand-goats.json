  "description": "Counting Sheepand Goats is a unique, artisanal cheese that blends the milk of cows, goats, and sheep, creating a complex flavor profile and a creamy, soft-ripened texture. Originating from a collaboration between Canadian and Italian cheesemakers, this cheese is a testament to the innovative spirit of modern cheesemaking. Its rind is typically bloomy, with a soft, yielding interior that becomes more fluid as it ages. The cheese's appearance is marked by a pale ivory color, with a slightly wrinkled rind that hints at its artisanal production. Counting Sheepand Goats is celebrated for its ability to balance the distinct characteristics of each milk type, offering a harmonious blend of flavors that is both rich and nuanced.",
  "history": "Counting Sheepand Goats is a relatively new addition to the cheese world, born from a collaboration between Canadian and Italian cheesemakers. This cheese reflects a growing trend in the artisanal cheese industry towards blending different types of milk to create unique and complex flavors. The name itself, a playful nod to the milk sources, underscores the cheese's innovative approach. While it doesn't have a long historical lineage, it draws on the rich cheesemaking traditions of both Canada and Italy, countries known for their high-quality dairy products and innovative cheese techniques. This cheese is a symbol of the modern, global cheese culture, where traditional methods meet contemporary creativity.",
  "productionProcess": "Counting Sheepand Goats is made from a blend of cow, goat, and sheep milk, which is carefully selected for quality and flavor. The milk is gently pasteurized before being inoculated with specific cultures to start the fermentation process. Rennet is then added to coagulate the milk, forming curds that are cut and gently stirred. The curds are ladled into molds, where they are allowed to drain and form the cheese's shape. After unmolding, the cheese is salted and then aged in a controlled environment to develop its characteristic bloomy rind and creamy interior. The aging process typically lasts several weeks, during which the cheese develops its complex flavor profile and soft texture.",
  "flavorProfile": "Counting Sheepand Goats offers a rich and complex flavor profile, with notes of butter, nuts, and a slight tanginess from the goat milk. The sheep milk adds a subtle sweetness and depth, while the cow milk contributes to the cheese's creamy texture and mild base. The aroma is earthy and slightly mushroomy, with hints of fresh cream. The texture is luxuriously soft and creamy, becoming almost spoonable as it ripens, making it a delight to spread on crusty bread or crackers.",
  "pairings": "Counting Sheepand Goats pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. For a traditional pairing, try it with a crisp white wine like Sauvignon Blanc or a light-bodied red such as Pinot Noir. Beer enthusiasts might enjoy it with a Belgian-style ale, which complements the cheese's creamy texture and complex flavors. On the food side, it pairs wonderfully with fresh fruits like pears and apples, as well as with nuts and honey for a sweet and savory combination. For a more adventurous pairing, try it with a drizzle of truffle oil or alongside a charcuterie board featuring cured meats and olives.",
