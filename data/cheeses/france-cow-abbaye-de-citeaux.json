  "description": "Abbaye De Citeaux is a semi-soft, artisan cheese made from cow's milk, originating from the Burgundy region of France. This cheese is named after the Cistercian monks of the Abbaye de Cîteaux, who have a long-standing tradition of cheesemaking. It features a smooth, slightly elastic texture and a pale yellow interior, encased in a natural, washed rind that develops a distinctive orange hue as it ages. The cheese is known for its rich, buttery flavor with subtle earthy and nutty undertones, making it a favorite among cheese connoisseurs. Its unique brining process contributes to its slightly salty taste and helps preserve its moisture, ensuring a creamy mouthfeel.",
  "history": "The Abbaye De Citeaux cheese has its roots deeply embedded in the monastic traditions of the Cistercian monks at the Abbaye de Cîteaux in Burgundy, France. The monks have been producing cheese since the Middle Ages, using techniques passed down through generations. This cheese is a testament to their dedication to preserving traditional cheesemaking methods while embracing the natural bounty of their surroundings. The Abbaye de Cîteaux itself is one of the oldest Cistercian monasteries, and its cheese is a reflection of the monks' commitment to quality and craftsmanship. Over the centuries, this cheese has become a symbol of the region's rich culinary heritage.",
  "productionProcess": "Abbaye De Citeaux is made from high-quality cow's milk, which is gently heated and then curdled using traditional rennet. The curds are cut, drained, and molded into wheels before being brined, a process that imparts a slight saltiness and helps form the cheese's characteristic rind. After brining, the cheese is aged for several weeks in the monastery's cellars, where it develops its complex flavors and creamy texture. The aging environment, with its controlled humidity and temperature, is crucial for the development of the cheese's unique characteristics. The monks' meticulous attention to detail ensures that each wheel of Abbaye De Citeaux meets their high standards.",
  "flavorProfile": "Abbaye De Citeaux offers a rich and buttery flavor profile, with a creamy texture that melts in the mouth. It has subtle earthy and nutty notes, complemented by a slight tanginess from the brining process. The aroma is mild yet inviting, with hints of grass and mushrooms, reflecting the pastoral environment of its origin. The cheese's semi-soft texture provides a satisfying mouthfeel, making it a delightful experience for cheese lovers.",
  "pairings": "Abbaye De Citeaux pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include crusty bread, fresh fruits like apples and pears, and nuts such as walnuts and almonds. For a more indulgent experience, try it with honey or fig jam. Wine enthusiasts will appreciate its compatibility with Burgundy wines, particularly Pinot Noir, which complements its earthy notes. Beer lovers can enjoy it with a Belgian Dubbel or a farmhouse ale. For a unique twist, incorporate Abbaye De Citeaux into a cheese fondue or serve it alongside charcuterie for a sophisticated appetizer.",
