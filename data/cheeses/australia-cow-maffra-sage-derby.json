  "description": "Maffra Sage Derby is a distinctive semi-hard artisan cheese originating from Australia, specifically crafted by the Maffra Cheese Company. This cheese is celebrated for its unique infusion of sage, which imparts a subtle, herby flavor and a striking green marbling throughout its pale yellow body. The texture of Maffra Sage Derby is smooth and slightly crumbly, making it a versatile choice for various culinary applications. Its appearance is marked by the vibrant green streaks of sage, creating a visually appealing contrast that is as delightful to the eye as it is to the palate. This cheese is a testament to the innovative spirit of Australian cheesemaking, blending traditional techniques with local flavors.",
  "history": "Maffra Sage Derby has its roots in the rich cheesemaking traditions of Australia, where the Maffra Cheese Company has been a pioneer in producing high-quality, artisanal cheeses. The cheese draws inspiration from the classic English Sage Derby, a cheese known for its sage infusion and historical significance in British cheesemaking. The Maffra Cheese Company has adapted this tradition, incorporating local Australian sage to create a unique variant that pays homage to its origins while offering a distinct flavor profile. This cheese is a relatively recent addition to the Australian cheese scene but has quickly gained popularity for its innovative approach and exceptional quality.",
  "productionProcess": "Maffra Sage Derby is made from cow's milk, which is carefully selected for its quality and richness. The milk is pasteurized and then curdled using traditional rennet, a process that ensures the cheese develops its characteristic texture. After curdling, the curds are cut, drained, and pressed to form the cheese's semi-hard structure. The distinctive sage infusion is added during the curdling process, allowing the herb's flavor to permeate the cheese evenly. The cheese is then aged for several weeks to develop its flavor and texture further. The aging process is carefully monitored to ensure the cheese achieves the perfect balance of firmness and flavor.",
  "flavorProfile": "Maffra Sage Derby offers a delightful sensory experience, with a mild, creamy base complemented by the earthy, slightly peppery notes of sage. The aroma is fresh and herbaceous, hinting at the sage's presence. The texture is smooth yet slightly crumbly, providing a satisfying mouthfeel that enhances its overall appeal. The sage's flavor is well-integrated, offering a subtle complexity that makes this cheese a standout choice for those seeking something unique yet approachable.",
  "pairings": "Maffra Sage Derby pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include crusty bread, crackers, and fresh fruits like apples and pears, which complement its herby flavor. For a more adventurous pairing, try it with honey or fig jam to balance the sage's earthiness. Wine enthusiasts will appreciate its compatibility with light, crisp whites such as Sauvignon Blanc or a fruity Pinot Noir. Beer lovers can enjoy it with a pale ale or a wheat beer, which enhances its herbal notes. For a complete cheese board, include nuts like walnuts or almonds and some cured meats for a delightful contrast.",
