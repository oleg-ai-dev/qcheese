  "description": "Pecorino is a term used to describe Italian cheeses made from sheep's milk (the word 'pecora' means sheep in Italian). The most famous among them is Pecorino Romano, but there are several other varieties including Pecorino Sardo, Pecorino Toscano, and Pecorino Siciliano. These cheeses are hard, with a texture that can range from semi-soft in younger cheeses to very hard in aged varieties. The rind is usually natural, sometimes treated with olive oil or tomato to preserve it. Pecorino cheeses are known for their sharp, tangy flavor, which becomes more pronounced with age. They are typically aged for a minimum of 5 months, but some can be aged for over a year, developing a granular texture and a more intense flavor.",
  "history": "Pecorino cheese has a rich history that dates back to ancient Rome, where it was a staple in the diet of Roman soldiers due to its long shelf life and high nutritional value. The tradition of making Pecorino has been passed down through generations, with each region of Italy developing its own unique variety. Pecorino Romano, for example, was originally produced in the countryside around Rome but is now primarily made in Sardinia. The cheese holds a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status, ensuring that only cheeses produced in specific regions using traditional methods can bear the name.",
  "productionProcess": "Pecorino is made from whole sheep's milk, which is heated and then curdled using rennet. The curd is cut into small pieces to release the whey, then pressed into molds to form the cheese. After molding, the cheese is salted, either by dry salting or brining, and then aged. The aging process can vary from a few months to over a year, depending on the desired flavor and texture. During aging, the cheese is regularly turned and brushed to prevent mold and to develop the rind.",
  "flavorProfile": "Pecorino cheeses are known for their sharp, tangy, and slightly salty flavor, with a rich, buttery texture that becomes more granular and crumbly as it ages. The aroma is distinctly sheepy, with nutty and grassy notes that reflect the animal's diet. Younger Pecorino is milder and creamier, while aged Pecorino has a more intense flavor and a harder texture.",
  "pairings": "Pecorino pairs wonderfully with full-bodied red wines like Chianti or Barolo, which can stand up to its robust flavor. It also goes well with white wines such as Vermentino or a crisp Pinot Grigio. For beer lovers, a hoppy IPA or a malty amber ale complements the cheese's sharpness. On the food side, Pecorino is excellent with honey, figs, and pears, which balance its saltiness. It's also a key ingredient in traditional Italian dishes like pasta carbonara and cacio e pepe.",
