  "description": "San Simón is a distinctive semi-soft cheese originating from the Galicia region of Spain, known for its unique pear shape and smoked flavor. Made exclusively from cow's milk, it boasts a smooth, creamy texture and a glossy, golden-yellow rind that results from the smoking process. The interior is pale yellow, dense, and slightly elastic, offering a delightful contrast to its smoky exterior. San Simón is celebrated for its balance of flavors, combining the richness of the milk with a subtle smokiness that doesn't overpower. Its unique shape and flavor profile make it a standout choice for cheese enthusiasts seeking something different.",
  "history": "San Simón cheese has its roots deeply embedded in the Galician culture of Spain, where it has been produced for centuries. The cheese is named after the San Simón mountain in the province of Lugo, reflecting its geographical and cultural significance. Traditionally, it was made by local farmers as a way to preserve milk. The smoking process, which gives San Simón its characteristic flavor, was initially used as a preservation method before refrigeration. Over time, it became a defining feature of the cheese, contributing to its popularity both within Spain and internationally. Today, San Simón holds a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status, ensuring its production adheres to strict traditional methods.",
  "productionProcess": "San Simón cheese is made from pasteurized cow's milk, which is curdled using animal rennet. The curds are then cut, heated, and pressed into molds, giving the cheese its distinctive pear shape. After molding, the cheese is brined to enhance flavor and preserve it. The most distinctive step in its production is the smoking process, where the cheese is smoked over birch wood for about two weeks. This not only imparts a unique smoky flavor but also contributes to the cheese's golden-yellow rind. Finally, the cheese is aged for a minimum of 45 days, during which it develops its characteristic texture and flavor profile.",
  "flavorProfile": "San Simón cheese offers a complex flavor profile that combines the creamy richness of cow's milk with a distinctive smoky aroma. The taste is buttery and slightly tangy, with a smooth, creamy texture that melts in the mouth. The smokiness is present but not overwhelming, providing a perfect balance that enhances the cheese's natural flavors. Its aroma is inviting, with hints of wood and a subtle earthiness that complements its taste.",
  "pairings": "San Simón cheese pairs wonderfully with a variety of foods and beverages. Its smoky flavor complements cured meats like chorizo and jamón, making it a great addition to charcuterie boards. For a traditional Galician experience, serve it with crusty bread and a glass of local Albariño wine, which balances the cheese's richness with its crisp acidity. Beer enthusiasts might enjoy it with a smoky porter or stout that echoes its smoked notes. For a sweet contrast, pair San Simón with quince paste or honey. It also works well in salads, adding a smoky depth to greens and nuts.",
