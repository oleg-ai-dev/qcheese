  "description": "Castelo Branco is a traditional Portuguese cheese, originating from the Beira Baixa region, specifically around the city of Castelo Branco. This semi-soft cheese is made from a blend of goat's and sheep's milk, giving it a unique flavor profile that is both rich and slightly tangy. The cheese has a creamy texture and a pale yellow interior, encased in a natural rind that can range from yellow to orange, depending on the aging process. Its aroma is distinctly earthy, with hints of the pastures where the animals graze. Castelo Branco is often compared to its cousin, Serra da Estrela, but it is firmer and less buttery, making it a versatile cheese for various culinary applications.",
  "history": "Castelo Branco cheese has deep roots in the rural traditions of Portugal, particularly in the Beira Baixa region. It is named after the city of Castelo Branco, which serves as the cultural and economic hub of the area. The cheese is a product of the region's pastoral heritage, where sheep and goat farming have been integral to the local economy for centuries. Historically, Castelo Branco was made by shepherds and farmers as a way to preserve milk. Over time, it gained recognition beyond its local origins, becoming a celebrated part of Portugal's rich cheesemaking tradition. Today, it holds a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status, ensuring its production adheres to strict regional standards.",
  "productionProcess": "Castelo Branco cheese is crafted using a blend of raw or pasteurized goat's and sheep's milk. The milk is gently heated and then curdled using animal rennet. The curds are cut, drained, and molded into the characteristic cylindrical shape. The cheese is then salted and left to age for a minimum of 20 days, though some varieties are aged longer for a more pronounced flavor. During aging, the cheese develops its natural rind and creamy interior. The production process emphasizes traditional methods, with many producers still using artisanal techniques passed down through generations.",
  "flavorProfile": "Castelo Branco cheese offers a complex flavor profile that balances creamy richness with a slight tanginess. The blend of goat's and sheep's milk imparts a distinctive earthy and nutty taste, complemented by a subtle sweetness. Its aroma is robust, with grassy and floral notes that reflect the animals' diet. The texture is semi-soft, smooth, and slightly elastic, making it a delight to eat on its own or as part of a dish.",
  "pairings": "Castelo Branco pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. Traditional pairings include crusty bread, quince paste (marmelada), and olives. For wine, try a robust red like a Douro or Alentejo, or a crisp white such as Vinho Verde. Beer enthusiasts might enjoy it with a malty ale or a fruity lambic. For a modern twist, serve it with honey-drizzled figs or a charcuterie board featuring cured meats and nuts.",
