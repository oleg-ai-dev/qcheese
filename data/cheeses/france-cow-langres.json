  "description": "Langres is a distinctive French cheese, originating from the Champagne-Ardenne region. It is easily recognizable by its concave top, a result of the cheese being washed with brine and annatto, which gives it a unique orange hue. The cheese is made from cow's milk and has a semi-soft texture, with a creamy and slightly runny interior as it ages. Its rind is washed, contributing to its strong aroma and complex flavor profile. Langres is often enjoyed with a splash of Champagne poured into its characteristic 'well', enhancing its flavors and making it a luxurious treat.",
  "history": "Langres cheese has a rich history dating back several centuries in the Champagne region of France. It was traditionally made by farmers as a way to preserve milk. The cheese gained AOC (Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée) status in 1991, which protects its name and ensures it is produced according to strict guidelines within its region of origin. Langres is deeply embedded in the local culture and is celebrated for its unique production methods and distinctive taste.",
  "productionProcess": "Langres is produced from cow's milk, which is first curdled using rennet. The curds are then cut, gently stirred, and molded by hand. After molding, the cheese is salted and washed with brine and annatto, which helps develop its flavor and color. The aging process lasts for at least 5 weeks, during which the cheese is regularly turned and washed. This process encourages the growth of specific bacteria on the rind, contributing to its strong aroma and creamy texture.",
  "flavorProfile": "Langres offers a complex flavor profile that is both bold and nuanced. It has a pronounced, slightly tangy taste with earthy and nutty undertones. The aroma is strong and pungent, characteristic of washed-rind cheeses. Its texture is creamy and smooth, becoming more liquid near the rind as it ages. The combination of its flavor and texture makes Langres a memorable cheese experience.",
  "pairings": "Langres pairs beautifully with Champagne or a light, fruity red wine, which complements its creamy texture and robust flavor. For beer enthusiasts, a Belgian ale or a crisp lager can also be a great match. Accompaniments might include crusty bread, fresh fruits like apples or pears, and nuts. The traditional method of pouring Champagne into the cheese's well before serving adds an extra layer of indulgence to the pairing.",
