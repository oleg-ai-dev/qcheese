  "description": "Cabecou is a delightful soft cheese made from goat's milk, originating from the Midi-Pyrénées region in France. This cheese is known for its small, flat, and round shape, typically about 5 cm in diameter and 1 cm thick. It has a soft, creamy texture that becomes more spreadable as it ages. The rind is thin and edible, often developing a slight bloom of white mold. Cabecou is celebrated for its fresh, tangy flavor with a hint of nuttiness, making it a favorite among cheese enthusiasts. Its artisanal production and unique taste profile set it apart in the world of goat cheeses.",
  "history": "Cabecou cheese has a rich history rooted in the rural traditions of the Midi-Pyrénées region in France. The name 'Cabecou' comes from the Occitan word 'cabra', meaning goat, reflecting its primary ingredient. Historically, this cheese was made by local farmers as a way to preserve goat's milk. Over time, it gained popularity beyond its region of origin, becoming a cherished part of French cheese culture. Today, Cabecou is appreciated for its artisanal qualities and is often enjoyed as part of a traditional French cheese platter.",
  "productionProcess": "Cabecou is made from fresh goat's milk, which is gently heated and then curdled using natural lactic acid bacteria. The curds are carefully ladled into small molds, allowing the whey to drain naturally. The cheese is then lightly salted and left to age for a short period, typically around two weeks. During this time, it develops a thin, edible rind and a creamy interior. The artisanal process emphasizes minimal intervention, preserving the natural flavors of the goat's milk.",
  "flavorProfile": "Cabecou offers a fresh, tangy flavor with a subtle nuttiness. Its aroma is mild and slightly earthy, characteristic of goat's milk cheeses. The texture is soft and creamy, becoming more spreadable as it ages. The thin rind adds a delicate, slightly mushroomy note, enhancing the overall sensory experience.",
  "pairings": "Cabecou pairs beautifully with light, crisp white wines such as Sauvignon Blanc or a dry Rosé. It also complements fruity beers and ciders. For food pairings, try it with fresh baguettes, honey, or fig jam. It can be served alongside mixed greens in a salad or melted over roasted vegetables for a creamy, tangy touch. For a traditional French experience, enjoy it with walnuts and a drizzle of walnut oil.",
