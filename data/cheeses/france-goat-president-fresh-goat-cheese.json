  "productionProcess": "President Fresh Goat Cheese is made from 100% goat's milk, which is pasteurized to ensure safety while retaining the milk's natural flavors. The milk is then curdled using a specific type of rennet, a traditional method that helps achieve the cheese's firm texture. After curdling, the cheese is drained and shaped, undergoing a brief aging process to develop its characteristic tangy flavor. The entire process is carefully monitored to maintain the cheese's freshness and quality, making it a favorite among cheese lovers.",

Its aroma is fresh and inviting, with subtle hints of the grassy pastures where the goats graze. The balance of tanginess and creaminess makes it a versatile cheese, suitable for a wide range of dishes.",
  "pairings": "President Fresh Goat Cheese pairs wonderfully with crisp white wines such as Sauvignon Blanc or a light Chardonnay, which complement its tangy flavor. For beer enthusiasts, a pale ale or a wheat beer can be a great match. On the food side, it goes well with fresh fruits like figs and pears, nuts, and crusty bread. It's also a fantastic addition to salads, adding a creamy texture and a burst of flavor.",
