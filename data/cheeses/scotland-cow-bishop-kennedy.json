  "description": "Bishop Kennedy is a soft, washed-rind cheese originating from Scotland, made from cow's milk. It is known for its distinctive orange rind and creamy, supple interior. The cheese has a pungent aroma, characteristic of washed-rind varieties, but offers a surprisingly mild and buttery flavor with a hint of earthiness. Its texture is smooth and spreadable, making it a versatile choice for cheese lovers. Bishop Kennedy is often compared to French cheeses like Époisses or Munster, but it carries a unique Scottish identity in its flavor profile and production methods.",
  "history": "Bishop Kennedy is a relatively modern cheese, developed in Scotland as part of a revival of artisanal cheesemaking traditions. Named after a 15th-century Scottish bishop, it reflects the country's growing interest in creating high-quality, locally produced cheeses. While Scotland is more traditionally known for its hard cheeses like cheddar, Bishop Kennedy represents a shift toward softer, more experimental styles. Its creation is a nod to European washed-rind cheeses, adapted to Scottish tastes and dairy practices.",
  "productionProcess": "Bishop Kennedy is made from pasteurized cow's milk, which is curdled using traditional rennet. The curds are gently cut and molded into small rounds, then washed with a brine solution during aging to encourage the growth of Brevibacterium linens, the bacteria responsible for its orange rind and pungent aroma. The cheese is aged for about 4-6 weeks, during which it develops its creamy texture and complex flavors. The washing process is repeated regularly to maintain the rind's moisture and character.",
  "flavorProfile": "Bishop Kennedy offers a rich, buttery flavor with a mild tang and earthy undertones. Its aroma is robust and slightly pungent, typical of washed-rind cheeses, but the taste is surprisingly approachable. The texture is creamy and smooth, almost spoonable when fully ripe, with a slight firmness near the rind.",
  "pairings": "Bishop Kennedy pairs beautifully with crusty bread, fresh fruits like apples or pears, and nuts such as walnuts or almonds. For beverages, try it with a crisp white wine like Chardonnay or a light red wine such as Pinot Noir. Beer enthusiasts might enjoy it with a Belgian-style ale or a malty Scottish brew. For a more adventurous pairing, serve it with a drizzle of honey or a dollop of fruit preserves.",
