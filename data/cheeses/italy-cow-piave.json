  "description": "Piave is a distinguished hard cheese originating from the Belluno province in the Veneto region of Italy, named after the Piave River. It boasts a dense, compact texture and a natural rind that ranges from pale yellow to a deeper amber with aging. The cheese is celebrated for its versatility and depth of flavor, which intensifies as it matures. Piave is available in several age categories, each offering a unique taste experience, from the younger, milder Piave Fresco to the more complex and robust Piave Vecchio.",
  "history": "Piave cheese has its roots deeply embedded in the rich dairy traditions of the Dolomites area in Northern Italy. It was first produced in the 1960s as a way to utilize the abundant milk from the local cows grazing on the alpine pastures. Over the years, Piave has gained recognition for its quality and distinctive flavor, becoming a staple in Italian cuisine and a proud representative of the Veneto region's cheesemaking heritage.",
  "productionProcess": "Piave is made from pasteurized cow's milk, which is curdled using natural calf rennet. The curds are then cooked and pressed into molds, where they are salted and left to age. The aging process varies depending on the type of Piave being produced, ranging from a few months for the younger varieties to over a year for the more aged versions. This meticulous process contributes to the cheese's characteristic texture and flavor profile.",
  "flavorProfile": "Piave offers a rich and nutty flavor with hints of sweetness, which becomes more pronounced and complex as the cheese ages. The texture is firm yet smooth, making it a delight to both the palate and the senses. Younger versions are milder and creamier, while aged Piave develops a sharper, more intense taste with a slightly granular texture.",
  "pairings": "Piave pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. It complements full-bodied red wines such as Amarone or Barolo, enhancing the cheese's nutty flavors. For a lighter pairing, try it with a crisp white wine or a hoppy IPA. Piave also shines on a cheese board, accompanied by fruits like pears and figs, or with a drizzle of honey for a sweet contrast. It's equally delicious grated over pasta or risotto, adding depth and richness to the dish.",
