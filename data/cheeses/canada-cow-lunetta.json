  "history": "Lunetta cheese, while not as widely documented as some of its counterparts, represents a beautiful fusion of Canadian and Italian cheese-making traditions. The name 'Lunetta' suggests a nod to Italian heritage, possibly inspired by the moon ('luna' in Italian), indicating something small and delicate. In Canada, the artisanal cheese movement has embraced such fresh cheeses, incorporating local techniques and flavors. This cheese is a testament to the global journey of cheese-making, blending the old-world charm of Italian cheese traditions with the innovative spirit of Canadian artisans.",
  "productionProcess": "Lunetta cheese is produced using fresh cow's milk, which is gently curdled using natural enzymes to preserve the milk's delicate flavors. The curds are then carefully handled to maintain their soft texture, before being lightly pressed and shaped. Unlike aged cheeses, Lunetta is meant to be enjoyed fresh, which means it undergoes minimal aging, if any. This process ensures that the cheese retains its moisture, softness, and fresh taste, making it a delightful addition to any cheese board or dish.",
  "flavorProfile": "Lunetta cheese boasts a mild, creamy flavor with a subtle tanginess that is characteristic of fresh cow's milk cheeses. Its aroma is fresh and inviting, with a hint of sweetness that complements its soft, spreadable texture. The cheese's flavor is not overpowering, making it an excellent choice for those who prefer a more understated cheese experience.",
  "pairings": "Lunetta cheese pairs wonderfully with a variety of foods and beverages. For a traditional pairing, try it with a crisp white wine or a light beer to complement its creamy texture and mild flavor. It also goes well with fresh fruits like pears and apples, or with a drizzle of honey for a sweet contrast. For a more innovative approach, incorporate Lunetta into a fresh salad or use it as a base for a savory tart. Its versatility makes it a fantastic addition to any meal.",
