  "description": "Prima Donna is a premium Dutch cheese that combines the rich, nutty flavors of aged Gouda with the creamy, buttery texture of Parmigiano-Reggiano. Originating from the Netherlands, this cow's milk cheese is known for its hard texture and deep, golden-yellow color. Prima Donna is aged for a minimum of 12 months, which contributes to its complex flavor profile and slightly crystalline texture. The cheese is encased in a natural rind that is often coated with a protective layer to preserve its quality during aging. Prima Donna is celebrated for its versatility, making it a favorite among cheese connoisseurs and culinary professionals alike.",
  "history": "Prima Donna was developed in the Netherlands as an innovative cheese that bridges the gap between Gouda and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Its creation was inspired by the desire to produce a cheese that embodies the best qualities of both worlds: the creamy, melt-in-your-mouth texture of Gouda and the sharp, nutty flavor of Parmigiano. Since its introduction, Prima Donna has gained international acclaim for its unique characteristics and has become a staple in the Dutch cheese repertoire. It represents a modern approach to traditional cheesemaking, showcasing the Netherlands' ability to innovate within its rich dairy culture.",
  "productionProcess": "Prima Donna is made from high-quality cow's milk, which is carefully selected to ensure the cheese's premium taste and texture. The milk is pasteurized and then curdled using traditional rennet. After the curds are formed, they are pressed into molds and brined to enhance flavor and preserve the cheese. Prima Donna undergoes a meticulous aging process, lasting at least 12 months, during which it develops its distinctive flavor and texture. The cheese is regularly turned and brushed to ensure even aging and to maintain its quality. This process results in a cheese that is both flavorful and versatile.",
  "flavorProfile": "Prima Donna boasts a rich, nutty flavor with hints of caramel and a slight tanginess that becomes more pronounced with age. Its texture is firm yet creamy, with small, crunchy crystals that add a delightful contrast. The aroma is complex, with notes of butter and toasted nuts, making it a sensory delight for cheese lovers.",
  "pairings": "Prima Donna pairs beautifully with a variety of foods and beverages. For wine enthusiasts, it complements full-bodied reds like Cabernet Sauvignon and rich whites such as Chardonnay. Beer lovers will enjoy it with Belgian ales or stout. On the table, it enhances the flavors of fruits like pears and apples, nuts, and dark chocolate. Prima Donna also shines in cooked dishes, adding depth to risottos, pastas, and gratins.",
